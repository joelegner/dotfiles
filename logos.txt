## 2006-03-20

Gave up on Debian AMD 64.  Installed 32-bit Etch (testing) system.  Detected
SATA drive, but I chose to install on 80GB IDE drive.  I want to keep things
simple!
    
## 2006-03-21

Installed phpMyAdmin.

Copied Building from leg to legner1 and started phpBEARS project.

Installed nVidia driver from apt.  This resulted in much less flicker than the
default Vesa driver.  Note that the driver is listed as nvidia in
``/etc/X11/xorg.conf``, not nv.

Source files should rightly go under ``/usr/src``

To stop xserver, use ``/etc/init.d/gdm stop``
To start it, user ``/etc/init.d/gdm start``

In KDE, ALT-F2 brings up a run window.

To rename all files and folders recursively to lowercase::
   $ find * -exec rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' "{}" \;

To merge PDF files use the pdfjoin command.  See man pdfjoin.

## 2006-03-22

Started phpBEARS project on new machine (legner1).  So far all I have done is
copy the original Building project from leg to ``/var/www/phpbears`` and resumed
working on the planning documents.  I slightly reorganized the planning
documents to make them more streamlined.

## 2006-03-23

To make a recursive, incremental backup with rsync::

   rsync -a --delete -u -R source/ dest/

where ``source/`` and ``dest/`` are the directory paths.  For example::

   rsync -a --delete -u -R /home/legnerjm/ /home/legner1/backups/

Got GD to work with PHP (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.image.php)::

   apt-get install php5-gd.
   apache2 -k stop
   apache2 -k start

## 2006-03-24

Julie put a notice on Freecycle for our cat, "Josey," and someone came and
picked her up today.  She had been living in the storage room which was not a
good place for her.  She will be better off now on a farm in Clinton, Illinois.

Added functionality to chcase to replace spaces with underscore characters.
Now use: ``chcase -r -d -s *``

Finally found a good script to change the case of file and directory names: chcase from http://www.blemished.net/chcase

2013-01-10 now located here: http://chcase.sourceforge.net/

To rename files and sub-directories::

   chcase -r -d *

Using the 32-bit Debian has been a godsend.  I even have OpenOffice 2.0
working - I couldn't get ANY version of OOo to work on AMD64!  I will probably
give it a shot in a year or two.

Revised backup script to keep a rotating daily backup named
``/home/legner1/backups/daily/0-Sun, 1-Mon, ..., 6-Sat``.  This is only for
``legeng``, ``legnerjm``, and ``/var/www directories``.

The daily backup script is ``/root/scripts/backup-daily.sh``.  Also made
``backup-weekly.sh`` that runs on Friday 7:00 pm (cron).

## 2006-03-25

We took Joey to Chuck E. Cheese for food and playtime tonight.

Happy day as we cleaned out the storage room; it was filthy due to the
occupancy of the cat.  I vacuumed and then mopped the floor with a bleach
solution.

mtools are useful for accessing DOS floppies:
mdir a:
mcopy a:dos_file unix_file

Found a bunch of old floppys with Quicken backups.  Being paranoid, I formatted
them before throwing them away.  To format a floppy in Linux, use kfloppy or
gfloppy.

## 2006-03-26

Verified my daily backup script on legner1 works.  I need to copy it to leg
soon.  Also need a maintenance script which runs updatedb and apt-get
update.

## 2006-03-27

legner1 died again, so it is in the shop.  I am writing this on leg.

## 2006-03-30

We ate dinner at Alexander's Steakhouse, and it was not very good.

Installed wxPython and tried it.  Looks really promising.  Maybe so-long
to C++ and friends!

Installed Vim and tried it out.  It may become my new text editor.

The computer guy called and said the motherboard burned out.  It is under
warranty.  This time they are putting a different motherboard in it, because
they have been having problems with the one they used originally.

## 2006-03-31

In Python, a class can have attributes and an instance of a class can have
attributes as well.  Class attributes are shared among all instances of a
class, while instance attributes are not.  The best place to create instance
attributes is in an __init__ function.  See:
http://www.zephyrfalcon.org/labs/python_pitfalls.html

Bought a book Python Pocket Reference at Borders.

Got legner1 back from the shop.  They took out the old motherboard and put a
new one in.  The tech said he got a grub error, but when I got it home it
loaded right up (knock on wood).

## 2006-04-02

Burned a DVD backup of the family pictures using GnomeBaker.  I wonder about
getting a safe deposit box for things like this.

## 2006-04-03

Today is my 33rd birthday!  We ate lunch at Buffalo Wild Wings, and they gave
me a piece of chocolate cake, which Joey helped eat.  Julie gave me an mp3
player.  When we got home, she baked a cake, and Joey helped decorate it.  I
made steaks and chicken on the grill.

## 2006-04-04

Primed new guitar pedal board.

Put apt-get update; apt-get upgrade; apt-get clean in a new maint.sh file which
is called by backup-daily.sh (all under /root/scripts/).

Installed package exuberant-ctags.  Use ctags [source files] to generate a tags
file in a source directory.  Then in GVIM, use these commands to jump to tags
(http://ctags.sourceforge.net/):

   :ta tag			Find a tag.
   Ctrl-]			Find the tag under the cursor.
   Ctrl-T			Return to previous location before jump to tag.

A lot of the help files on Debian are gzipped.  To view a .gz help file,
use zless instead of less.

Went to U of I today to the structural engineering conference held this year at
Beckman, where I used to work during college.

The higher the risk, the higher the compensation.

If you save the owner money or time, you should be compensated.

For consulting engineers, the term "brand" means the feeling a client gets when
interacting with the engineer.

Consulting engineering has a low margin.  Typically across the industry the
profit margin is about 6%, meaning for every $1.00 of revenue, a typical firm
has $0.94 of expenses.  For a low margin business, a small increase in revenue
greatly increases profit.

For example, suppose you increase your gross revenue by 1% to $1.01.  Then
your profit increases (1.01 - 0.94)/(1.00 - 0.94) = 16 2/3%

Most industries do not base their price on the cost of production like
consulting engineers do.  They segment their markets.

A deterministic system has no randomness.  In the computer science sense, it
means for a given input, the output will always be the same.  This contrasts
with probabilistic.

In a probibilistic system, the outcome depends upon a random factor such that,
for a given input, the output will not always be the same.  An example of this
is a Monte Carlo simulation.  Such a system is also called non-deterministic or
stochastic.

Dan Huntington called me asking if I could help out on a project.  He is
sending me a care package for my better understanding.

## 2006-04-12

Worked out a deal with Dan to execute the project for $19,000 fee, which is the
largest fee I've ever had!  We'll see how their agreement looks.

Mike Ruff wants me to draw up some plans for his new truss plant.  He no longer
supplies trusses for Hundman.  This is his third plant now, and I hope he makes
it this time.  I don't know what went wrong last time.

Hlade's Law - If you have a difficult task, give it to a lazy person; they will
find an easier way to do it.

Hanlon's Razor - Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately
explained by stupidity.

Ockham's Razor - When two explanations are offered for a phenomenon, the
simpler full explanation is preferable

Peter Principle - In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level
of incompetence.

Wirth's law - Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.

Amara's law - We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the
short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.

Oops, it's been too long.  Joey went #2 on his little potty tonight for the
first time.  He is growing up.  We had band practice; we'll be playing at a bar
called Paulie's on Friday.  The band bought two lights: Chauvet Stage Wash

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import calendar
   >>> print calendar.calendar(2006)
   >>> import copy
   >>> x = copy.copy(y)        # make a shallow copy of y
   >>> x = copy.deepcopy(y)    # make a deep copy of y

For an object with references to other objects: copy() - inserts the same
references into the copy.  deepcopy() - copies the nested objects recursively.

## 2006-10-14

Program components:

   Input - data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.

   Output - show data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.

   Math - Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
   multiplication.

   Conditional Execution - if-then logic

   Repetition - loops

   Program errors:

      Syntax - code violates the rules for the language: x = (4 - 1x]

      Runtime - exceptions occur while program is executing.

      Semantic - program does not do what it is intended to do.

Suppose you have::

   >>> def twice(x):
   >>>     return x*2
   >>> twice(3)
   6

The number 3 is an argument, and the variable x is a parameter.  When the
function is called twice(3), the argument 3 is assigned to the parameter x.

A state diagram shows the value assigned to each variable.  A stack diagram is
a series of state diagrams, one for each scope.

State diagram::

   +------------+
   | a -> 4.5   |
   | b -> "Joe" |
   +------------+

Stack diagram::

    __init__    +------------+
                | a -> 4.5   |
                | b -> "Joe" |
                +------------+

    twice       +------------+
                | x -> 3     |
                +------------+

In Python, strings are immutable.

Slices in Python::

    >>> x = "Monte Python"
    >>> x[0:4]
    'Mont'

Why?  Imagine the indices refer to lines between characters::

    |M|o|n|t|e| |P|y|t|h|o|n
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011

Then the slice is from 0 to 4::

    |M|o|n|t|
    0 1 2 3 4

Collection types in Python:

   list: mutable, enclosed in brackets []

   tuple: immutable, enclosed in parenthesis ()

   dictionary: mutable, enclosed in braces {}.  A dictionary can use any
   immutable type as its index.

Aliasing means assigning two names to the same object.  If they refer to a
mutable object, assigning the copy a new value will change the original.  For
example::

    >>> x = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> y = x
    >>> y[0] = 3
    >>> print x
    [3, 5, 6]

Here x and y are both aliases for the list [4, 5, 6] which is later [3, 5, 6].

## 2006-10-20

To get the right letters from a string, use negative slice indexes::

    >>> str = "Joe Legner"
    >>> str[-4:]

Solved NVIDIA crisis:

Install Kernel Source

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install linux-source-2.6.27 - replace 2.6.17 with your kernel
   $ version ('uname -a' or 'uname -r')
   $ cd /usr/src
   $ tar -jxvf linux-source-2.6.17
   $ ln -s linux-source-2.6.12 linux

Install Kernel Headers

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.17-2

Install nVidia Drivers

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run

Finally, Reboot to get back into X.

Went to NVIDIA website and downloaded most recent driver for Linux.  Needed
kernel sources, so I installed linux-source-2.6.17.

After a recent update, X.org is slow.  It takes up a lot of CPU when
scrolling.  Firefox is basically unusable now because of the slow scrolling.

In /var/log/Xorg.0.log, there is a mysterious error message:
``(EE) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable``

I believe my video card is a NVIDIA GeForce 6100

Later, but appears to be unrelated:
``(EE) Error loading keymap /var/lib/xkb/server-0.xkm``

Tried to resolve X.org problem by dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and switching
from vesa to nv.  Did not work

To compute how many games back a team is from another:
[(fewer wins) + (extra losses)]/2

Or, if team 1 has W1 wins and L1 losses, team 2 has W2 wins and L2
losses, and team 1 is ahead of team 2, then team 2 is the following
number of games behind:

[(W1 - W2) + (L2 - L1)]/2

So the Cubs at 53-46 are behind the Brewers at 56-46:

[(56 - 53) + (46 - 46)]/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 games.

Set up rsync to work over ssh to transfer files from legner1 to phpwebhosting
for offsite storage.

To use without entering a password each time:

As legnerjm on legner1:

1.  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa::

      Generating public/private rsa key pair.
      Enter file in which to save the key (/home/legnerjm/.ssh/id_rsa):
      Created directory '/home/legnerjm/.ssh'.
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
      Enter same passphrase again:
      Your identification has been saved in /home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa.
      Your public key has been saved in /home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

The key fingerprint is::

      31:df:a5:73:4a:2f:a6:6c:1c:32:a2:f2:b3:c5:a7:1f legnerjm@legner1

2.  Login to remote computer (ash.phpwebhosting.com) as legner and create the
    .ssh directory::

      $ ssh -l legner ash.phpwebhosting.com mkdir -p .ssh
      legner@ash.phpwebhosting.com's password:

3.  Copy the legnerjm public key to legner@ash.phpwebhosting.com .ssh folder
    into authentication_hosts file. And, type the password again for the last
    time, hopefully::

      $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -l legner ash.phpwebhosting.com 
      >'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
      legner@ash.phpwebhosting.com's password


4.  ssh to ash.phpwebhosting.com and then::

      chmod 700 ~/.ssh
      chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

5.  Test::

      $ ssh -l legner ash.phpwebhosting.com

Something is true iff:

1. It is supported by two good sources.

2. It is not contracticted by a good source.

Sources are good iff:

1. They are independent.

2. They have no discernable conflict of interest (no reason to lie).

3. Their results are repeatable (tough for history).

A fact is something that has really occurred or is the case.

Friday - Renee B. came to our house for dinner.  Her girlfriend Kristy is up
north helping her dad do a construction project, and will be out of town until
after Christmas.  We had smoked salmon.  Renee brought an artichoke dip.  She
also brought her dog, "Brody" who is a 2 year old yellow lab they spent $1500
on.

Renee told a story about confronting car thieves that had stolen and totaled
Kristy's truck on the south side of St. Pete.  She confronted them with a golf
club.

Saturday night and we played music at Casey's Pub in St. Pete.  This was our
first electric Wonder Twins gig in Florida.  Charlie Nichol sat in on guitar
and bass.  Paul Caruthers also played bass, and a guy named Joey played the
drums.  Julie and I both liked Joey.

Joey is from Kentucky and is involved in conveyor components through his
father.  They may manufacture some or at least sell them.  He is 27 and claims
to have been a touring musician.  He currently has no drum set.  He was with
his neighbor, Elena, who was overtly romantically interested in Joey.

Paul and Peggy came by but it was after we already played.

David from DcR came with his Girlfriend  and her brother and another female
friend.

Julie and I took the kids around to look at Christmas lights.  First we went
out for ribs at Lucky B's Barbeque on 4th Street North in St. Pete and had a
slab of ribs that were good.

We stopped at 7-11 on MLK in St. Pete and went over west of MLK around 38th Ave
North.  On the way back, Julie dropped me off at the wine bar where Renee works
since I had promised to stop in on Sunday night.

While I was there, a woman named Ingrid bought me 2 beers. Ingrid is a
(lesbian?) pharmacist at Publix in NE Shopping Center, 200 37th Ave NE, St.
Petersburg. Renee said she was a regular, which she denied. We joked about
hemorrhoids. Drank Belgian beer.  Ingrid sneakily bought my drinks and then
left before Renee told me about it.

Worked at DcR on the rail pit for project 3738.  Read some of Getting Things
Done (GTD).

At 6:30 pm Julie went to Wine Madonna with Jennifer Caruthers for wine
tasting.  We are planning the upcoming holiday weekend.  I ran 2.13 miles in
19:54.

Moved GTD information into a Getting Things Done summary note as it was
cluttering my journal notes.

I have been listening to an audio book: The History of Western Philosophy by
Bertrand Russell.  So far all he has discussed are the Greeks.  It is very
interesting.  I like thinking about duality such as mind and body or empirical
versus rational.

## 2011-12-24

Paul Caruthers, Laurie S. and Renee B. came over and had dinner with us.  We
had hamburgers and chicken on the grill.  Laurie brought bakery buns and a
pecan pie that we never did eat.

Paul C. and I drank beer while the girls drank wine.  They teased Paul about
the beer drinking as it was said to be uncharacteristic of his habits.

At around 10 pm EST we attended a Skype call with Julie's extended family up
north and saw Terry, Scott, Jennifer, Kelli, Grandma McCoy, Doug, Bob, Bob's
girls, Mike and Kathy and their daughter.  The call only lasted about 15
minutes.

The kids were unusually gung-ho about going to bed on account of Santa's
imminent arrival.

## 2011-12-25

The kids woke us up at 5:09 am! I was able to hold out until 7:30 with the gift
unwrapping.  They kept coming in the room between those times, and Julie gave
them their stockings to pacify them.

The boys got lots of toys.  Joey got several Lego Harry Potter sets, and Tommy
got some Imaginext sets including a huge Batman bat cave set.

Julie gave me underwear, a Tee shirt with a sound level meter thing that really
works and Step Brothers on DVD.  She also gave me a case of special seasonal
Heineken beers.

I gave Julie a last-minute gift of a $50 spa gift certificate which I was able
to scratch together using my Legner Engineering business account.

The Bears played the Packers and lost 35-21 so they are eliminated from the
playoffs.  The Packers have home field advantage throughout.

In the late afternoon Paul Caruthers came over and then Paul Dengler and Peggy
Johnston came too.  We had a dinner of glazed spiral sliced ham, sweet
potatoes, broccoli and sweet peas and rolls.  Paul C. left early due to work on
Monday.  Paul and Peggy stayed a little later, and we enjoyed a fire pit and
roasted marshmallows.

A cat belonging to the neighbors to the north was on our boat lift and fell
into the water trying to jump to the dock.  It climbed up our mangrove tree and
escaped over the fence.  Julie checked with the neighbors and they said the cat
was home.

## 2011-12-26

DcR office closed today.

Spent day with the kids and Julie.  We took them to Toys R Us to attempt to
spend their gift cards from Uncle Ron, but the shelves were practically bare,
especially in the Lego area.  No bikes at all on the shelves either.

Ran 2 miles, but it was hard.

## 2011-12-27

Worked at DcR.  3738 Rail Load Out concrete pit design.  Wall reinf and
slab reinf.  Did some of the drafting of the drawings.  10 hours because
not sure about this coming week's holiday pay.

Created prelim Technipower time tickets and sent to Christy L. for review.
The previous week, this week and next week are confusing given the variety
of Technipower holiday dates and DcR office closure dates.

Julie and I are planning to go to St. Pete First Night on the 31st, and we
need tickets, but money is very tight right now.

I am pretty well now using the GTD system at work.  At home I am still
trying to get the first In Box cleared out.

Carmen Jordan asked for a fee proposal for aluminum railings, which I gave
to him via e-mail.  He wanted me to just seal and sign a simple drawing
provided by another, but it was lacking too much info.  I fear he did not
budget the $400 I requested.

Russ Arbuckle said he would send me a check.  Not sure if he did or not.
We need $400 to pay our upcoming health insurance.

Discovered Tommy again has pin worms.  Perhaps the whole family does.  Julie to
call a doc tomorrow.

## 2011-12-28

Worked at DcR.
   3738 Rail Load Out concrete pit design.
   Drawing markups.
   Beam pocket coordination.
   Worked 10 hours for 2nd day.  Tomorrow also 10.
   Per agreement with Frank Pirillo, will work 10 + 10 + 10 + 6  = 36
   hours but
   record 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 36 hours

Found out I had never paid the $107 to get my Massachusetts license.  Did so
today.

Answered a question from Darrell Stoller with Premier on 471 Brayton Point and
also was assured by him I will be getting 2 outstanding invoices paid.

Doctor said he will write a prescription for Tommy but not for the entire
family for the pin worms.  The other 3 of us will take an over-the-counter
remedy.  Need to clean the house, replace sheets, etc.

Designed an aluminum railing for Carmen Jordan.  Project No. 526.  Sent him
prelim drawings. He then asked me if he could pick them up in the morning, and
I said yes, so I stayed up until 11:12 pm doing so.

Darrell Stoller with Premier Fabrication sent me a small project to quote.
Wrote him that I would get back to him tomorrow 2011-12-29.

Re-programmed sprinklers at 4127 Coquina Key Dr SE to come on only 1 day a
week: Wednesday.

We had Chinese food for supper including, what else, Crab Rangoon!

## 2011-12-29

Worked at DcR.

Left drawings in mail slot for Carmen Jordan. He left me a check for $400.

Looked at a grain dryer support structure for Darrell Stoller with Premier
Fabrication.  He sent me a couple emails with additional info I need to check
out.

Wrote a preliminary set list for the Jan 21 gig at Casey's Pub and points
beyond with the recently electrified band.  We are going to need a website and
to settle on a name.

## 2011-12-31

We took a taxicab to downtown St. Petersburg for First Night with the kids,
bringing their red wagon in the trunk of the cab.  Several friends attended:
Kristy & Renee and Paul and Jennifer Caruthers.  We ate at a British pub called
Moon Under Water.  I had a chicken pot pie.  We saw fireworks at 9 pm.

Walked with kids to Renee's wine-tasting bar and sat on the balcony to
chit-chat until after midnight.  The kids fell asleep, and we took a cab home
safely.

## 2012-01-03

Worked at DcR on Rail Unloading project #3738.  Answered a question about the
Wet Rock job #3654.

Met Julie at the YMCA on 1st Ave. S in St. Pete and ran on the treadmill for 20
minutes at a little under 10 min/mile.

Went home and had spaghetti that Julie had made.

Baked banana bread.  Tommy and I both had a slice before bed.

## 2012-01-04

Worked at DcR on Rail Load Out project #3738.

Still listening to History of Western Philosophy by Bertrand Russell.  Now
about halfway through at the 12th century.

## 2012-01-20

Met Mike Stoup who is now my boss' boss. They supplied bagels.

My boss Frank at DcR said it was his intention to ask his superiors if he can
hire me directly on January 26 when my Technipower contract expires.

## 2012-12-05

Found out a CAD guy at work makes more money than me.

Discussed with Frank my concerns about CAD guy making more money than me. I
said it does not seem right considering the much higher risk and effort it
takes to run a project instead of just doing CAD.  Other highlights:

- DcR would pay for some 3D CAD training for me if works with schedule.

- My salary is in line with the other engineers in my department

- The current high CAD salary is an anomaly due to a 2nd offer

Yvonne came for a visit. Julie and she want shopping, then we ate out.

Set up 401(k) at DcR.  Contributing 9% to "balanced" fund.

Received check from CU Members Mortgage for $8472.98 which refunded money we
had paid into escrow that was not used: property taxes, homeowner's insurance
and flood insurance.  Julie deposited in our downpayment account.  We have
about $40000 in that account now.  I estimate $34000 to close on Rolling
Circle.

Received $349.00 check from Homeowners Choice for unused premium.

Received checks from CEFCU for having closed all our accounts.

In Vim, use semi-colon to repeat last f (find char) command.

; Repeat latest f, t, F or T [count] times.
, Repeat latest f, t, F or T in opposite direction [count] times.

I could create a crontab for this:

$ t -p ls @julie | mail -s "Julie todo.txt items" joelegner@gmail.com

When already in visual mode, can use text object commands to extend the
selection. 

Given:

[John has a (long mustache.)]

vi( will select long mustache.  Now that we are in visual mode, typing i[
will extend the selection to become John has a (long mustache.)

Went to Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa.  The kids got in free because of their
Grow Financial Bugg Club membership.  We paid $49.50 for the 2 adults.  We
saw virtually every exhibit by painstaking attention to the zoo map.  We

I had been waiting on information for a project so we could complete it.
Since there was nothing else to do, I asked my boss, Frank, if I could take
the week off since we had been wanting to go to Disney World for some time but
had not set a date.  With the kids being homeschooled and the weather
perfect for January, this turned out to be an opportune time.  He granted my
vacation.  Wouldn't you know it but within an hour the information arrived in
my email.  We kept going to Disney anyway.

We arrived at Disney and bought premium annual passes plus a week in their
Beach Club resort where Julie and I had stayed with her parents many years ago.
We walked into the International Gate of Epcot and had a gay time.

different office along the west wall if I wanted.  Mine is kind of small and
has crappy furniture.

Derek McPherson called and said he has an upcoming apartment project.  He will
send me some drawings and needs a price.  He is also coming down to Tampa

have been out of his booster seat at age 8 or 4'-9" high, whichever comes
first.  Therefore, we decided he could stop using his booster seat.  We took a

When I turn 70 and adopt a wiener dog, I am going to name him "Slow".  So I can
say, "I am going to walk Slow."

Saw gastroenterologist (GI) today regarding chronic bowel issues.  He ordered
blood work and scheduled a colonoscopy to make his diagnosis. 

My BP was 146/99 which is too high.  The GI prescribed a blood pressure
medication, but before I start taking something like that I want to engage a
primary care physician and get a physical.  I found a Michael C Burnette, MD
who seems good.  28 years experience and went to UNC which is a great school.
I will call tomorrow.

Woke up at 3 am.  Felt pain in my anal area, so I tried to apply some
Preparation-H.  There seemed to be a small mass or something in there and below
it an area painful to the touch.  The mass does not seem to be connected
physically to the underlying tender structure which seems large and could be a
muscle or tendon. Naturally at that early hour my mind thought the worst, so I
looked up anal cancer, knowing one of its outcomes - a colostomy - is one of my
worst fears.  Anyway, I ended up staying up the rest of the night reading and
worrying.  Here is what I found:

Anal Cancer
   Extremely rare among white males my age: 0.005% chance (about 5 per 100,000)
   of developing by age 40.  This would account best for the slow development
   of the pain and possibly the presence of a lump (tumor).  However, it does
   not seem to account for my bowel problems and seems to not have developed
   quickly enough to be cancer.  Besides, its probability is so low.  I will
   still mention it to my new primary care doctor on Friday during my physical

Abscess
   These are common and would explain the tender area.  The mass would be
   unexplained.  It was difficult to find the second time, but I did find it.
   It's hard to tell if the mass is painful or the larger underlying
   structure.  I think it's the underlying structure.  If it was an abscess,
   the underlying thing I felt is likely an inflamed area around the abscess.
   The contradictory evidence for an abscess is the long-term development and
   sustained pain I have experienced.  Treatment would be by draining it.

Crohn's Disease
   This is a good possibility, because it could simultaneously explain my bowel
   symptoms as well as the pain and itching in the anal area.  It is probably
   much more prevalent than anal cancer, on the order of 5-50 per 100,000.
   Here is a list of symptoms:

      Symptoms include persistent diarrhea (loose, watery, or frequent bowel
      movements), cramping abdominal pain, fever, and, at times, rectal
      bleeding. Loss of appetite and weight loss also may occur.

      Insidious onset - yes

      Inflammation of the eyes - no

      Inflammation of the skin - yes?  Face gets ruddy patches.

      Inflammation of the joints - no

   Of these, the loose bowel movements and cramping fit my symptoms.  It is
   also known to commonly affect the anal region.  It can cause mouth sores
   that don't heal, which happened to me some months back.  I was worried the
   sores would never heal.

The hippocampus (sea horse) is part of the human brain which deals with memory,
especially storing and retrieving declarative memories.  Those are memories
which can be expressed in words.  It might be a more poetic name for my
knowledgebase (KB) project.  Seahorse seems cleaner.  The reason is that the KB
project kind of functions in the same way, recording my declarative memories.
They HAVE to be declarative, because they are primarily in the form of words.

Julie bought me a blood pressure monitor from Walgreens at my request.  I
started around noon to measure my blood pressure.  I created a Google drive
spreadsheet called Health Journal which calculates the average BP from all my
entries.  As of the end of the day 2013-02-20, my average BP is 146/87 and my
average pulse is 72.  

The American Heart Association http://www.heart.org says of my readings:

   Systolic: 140 < 146 < 159 = Stage 1 Hypertension

   Diastolic: 80 < 87 < 89 = Prehypertension

These numbers agree fairly with my readings at the gastroenterologist which
were 146/99.  This is evidence the monitor is working properly.  I intend to
present this data to my new doctor on Friday, 2013-02-22.  I expect he will
prescribe blood pressure medication which I will be taking until I croak
someday hopefully many years from now

Apparently a pulse rate anywhere from 60 to 100 is normal.

Julie took the kids to Disney.  Tommy (7) rode on the Yeti ride at Animal
Kingdom.  He overcame his fear, and I complimented him on the phone when he
called.

Worked out with weights.  Making some progress especially in squats and dead
lifts.  When I measured my BP immediately after, the exercise did not seem to
have a significant impact on the readings.

## 2013-02-21

Julie thinks that Aspartame in Diet Pepsi is doing bad things to me.  To rule
out this possibility, I am forgoing diet sodas for the next week, starting
today to see what the effects might be.  I drank a cup of black coffee at work instead.

Today I learned the flamboyant country singer suits with designs a la Rhinstone
Cowboy, back in the 70s are called Nudie Suites after their designer, Nudie
Cohn.

My friend Matt Blaetz's mother, Ruth Blaetz died in Milwaukee at age 67.  She
was stricken with Alzheimer's Disease and was living in an assisted living
facility called Francis House.

## 2013-02-22

I had a physical examination with my new primary care doctor: Michael Burnette,
M.D.  He looked at the blood tests my GI doctor Qazi had ordered.  There were
no abnormalities: liver, thyroid.  He checked my BP twice and got 120/80 each
time, but his nurse got 144/74.  He reviewed my BP records and gave me 14
sample piles of a blood pressure medication called Benicar.  In three weeks I
am going to see him again to assess the effectiveness.  I am hoping to be able
to talk him into a generic medication instead to save money.  The Benicar costs
something like $1.25 per dose.  Wal-Mart sells generic BP meds for $10 for a
90-day supply, or $0.11 per dose. 

The doctor had his nurse do an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check my heart.  To
my dismay, it came back with an "abnormal" result: possible right ventricular
hypertrophy.  He ordered an echocardiogram to rule out this possible heart
problem.  An echocardiogram is supposed to be superior to an EKG for diagnosing
the hypertrophy.

Apparently right ventricular hypertrophy is a heart abnormality where the walls
of the right ventricle are abnormally thick.  It is usually due to long-term
pulmonary (lung) hypertension.  The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs,
and when it is difficult to do that for a long period of time, it thickens.

The good news is that I do not seem to be exhibiting any of the symptoms of
right ventricular hypertrophy: chest pains, shortness of breath, dizziness,
fainting. The doctor thinks that there should not be a problem since I run
regularly without trouble.  My times have not decreased noticeably, although I
did have some trouble completing longer runs of 8 miles or so earlier this
year.  I attributed this to my doing weights (squats) the day before.  It is
conceivable that my heart abnormality made running more difficult, but I'm not
sure it would only show up after so many miles like that.

The bad news is that according to this website http://ecg.utah.edu/lesson/8,
the EKG is correct 90% of the time when right ventricular hypertrophy criteria
are met.

The echocardiogram should cost somewhere around $250 according to http://www.healthcarebluebook.com.

## 2013-02-23

At 9:14 am EST I took my first dose of BP medication.  Immediately before that
My BP measured 135/91.  I measured my BP 3 hours later at 12:15 pm and got an
average of 136/87 after 3 measurements.  Virtually no effect.

I went into the DcR office to work on a project for Derek McPherson: The
Foundry.  I spent the morning reviewing and marking up the drawings.  We are
supposed to issue 50% CDs a week from Monday.

## 2013-02-25

Went to St. Joseph's Hospital on Martin Luther King Jr. Street in Tampa for my
echocardiogram.  The procedure took about 10 minutes.  The radiology technician
could not give me any information.  The data will go to a cardiologist who will
evaluate it.  Then the results will be transcribed and forwarded to my primary
care physician Dr. Burnette.  The tech said it would take 2-3 days' time, which
would be Wednesday or Thursday of this week. 

I am of course nervous about the results.  If I am diagnosed with right
ventricular hypertrophy, I hope it will serve as a lesson to my sons that they
need to take care of their bodies by exercise and regular doctor checkups.


## 2013-02-26

Today I was on a clear liquid diet and started heavy laxatives at noon to clean
out my lower GI tract for my colonoscopy tomorrow.  Here is a brief
play-by-play for the first couple hours:

12:00 took 1st 8 oz miralax
12:00 took 2 dulcolax
12:00 weight 183.8 with shorts and t-shirt
12:15 started 2nd 8 oz miralax
12:16 diarrhea
12:36 it's really working!
1:10 went again
1:18 almost no solids already
1:23 again almost no solids
1:28 wham
1:38 boom
2:11 yucky
2:27 finished last of the miralax

I kind of lost interest in tracking my very frequent bouts after this time.
Suffice it to say it was not an enjoyable process, but I did manage to get
through it with good results.  I was not craving food, surprisingly.  Maybe the
laxatives make the body feel ill and suppress the appetite.  I don't know.  I
was glad to have taken the day off from work; otherwise it would have been
nightmarish. 

## 2013-02-27

Today I had a colonoscopy at Brandon Ambulatory Surgery Center.  I arrived
about 7:45 am as instructed and filled out forms.  I was taken back around 8:30
am and a nurse tried to place an IV in my right hand but failed.  Another nurse
succeeded in my left hand.  I signed some papers and answered some general
questions posed by the nurse.  She had me undress and put on a hospital gown.
I then waited at least a half hour until the anesthesiologist come and spoke to
me.

I informed the anesthesiologist about the possible right ventricular
hypertrophy diagnosis.  He asked me some questions and concluded it was likely
to be a false positive and was not concerned.  He was good about telling me
what to expect from the procedure.

I think it was about 9:15 am when they wheeled me into surgery room 8.  The
anesthesiologist's partner did the actual administering of the drug.  Right as
I started to go under I quipped, "This is what Charlie Sheen feels like all the
time." 

The next thing I knew, I was waking up in the recovery area.  A nurse brought
me a bottle of water which was the first thing I had eaten or drank other than
my blood pressure pill since the day before.  They put me in a wheel chair and
took me out where my wife could join me.  Dr. Qazi (gastroenterologist) then
debriefed me about the colonoscopy.

Dr. Qazi said he found no polyps, that he could rule out colon cancer and that
he took some samples for biopsies to try to ascertain the reason for my
recurring gastric distress.  He said I had some internal hemorrhoids but did
not elaborate.

After the surgery we ate at Steak N Shake which was a blessing.  I slept all
afternoon, woke up around 4 pm and was up until 8:30 pm when I went to bed
again. 

## 2013-02-28

After sleeping all night I slept through my alarm.  I texted my boss Frank and
said I would be in later and slept another hour, arriving at work at 9:00 am.

Tommy exhibited symptoms of pinworms again last night.  This has now been
ongoing for 3 years.  Julie took him to a pediatrician who is asking for stool
samples.

Lo and behold the pediatrician found a mole on the bottom of one of his feet
that concerns her.  She is sending him to a dermatologist.  The concern is
apparently a type of melanoma called "acral lentiginous melanoma" or "plantar
melanoma."  This kind of cancer is rare in Caucasians.  It is what killed the
reggae musician Bob Marley.  Intellectually I know it most likely is a benign
mole, but I am still worried.  It's one thing after another recently: bowels,
blood pressure, heart defect and now this.

I looked at Tommy's mole at lunch.  It is small and has well-defined borders.
It looks exactly like other moles he has on his skin.  I am not very worried,
but I did say to Julie that we should take him to a dermatologist to make sure
it's not that cancer.

TIL there is a type of melanoma (skin cancer) which shows up on the sole of the
foot where there is no sunlight exposure.  Because of its location, it is
particularly dangerous, because it is not often discovered until it has
developed past Stage I.

Julie filled my new BP medicine prescription: Lisinopril 10 mg tablets.  I took

There was blood on the tissue when I want #2 tonight around 7:30 pm.  Hopefully
it is nothing serious.  I was kind of constipated, so maybe it's a hemorrhoid.

   Some minor electrical issues.

It appears to me that the contract requires the seller to make repairs up to

Went to YouFit to work out and pulled a muscle in my lower back at the 4th repetition of the 4th set of squats.  I was squatting 145 lbs.  The pain was immediate.  I went home and iced my back and tried to keep from putting stress on it.

Our AC quit working, so Julie called a repair man.  It was Sunday.  The repair man kindly pointed out it was a safety switch which detects when the drain line is clogged.  We tried several things to unclog the drain line, including sucking on its discharge end with a shop vac and pouring drain cleaner down it, but it has been no use.  The AC is working, but only because the safety switch is currently defeated by removing it from its socket.

Julie took Tommy and Joey to the bowling alley.  Tommy went to a birthday party, and Julie took Joey and his friend Gabe to bowl as a special treat since Tommy attended two birthday parties this weekend.

My back was sore when I went to bed, and it was hard to sleep.

## 2014-09-08

My back was very sore and stiff when I got up, so much so that I found it hard to walk.  A hot shower helped, and I spent some 15 minutes stretching it thoroughly.  I also took two extra strength Tylenol.

I didn't know if I could do it, but I went to Duke's Hines plant anyway and was able to function all day.  It was mostly walking and sitting with a little bending over and kneeling to get through some tight spaces.  By the time my back muscles were warmed up I was doing pretty well.

Received a phone call from Steve Ericson (sp?) with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).  His number is 850-528-5404.  He said I will be contacted next week by Mark Beynon, the local inspector for my area.  Mark's number is 850-528-5391.

## 2014-09-09

My back was again stiff and sore.  If yesterday was a 10, today was probably an 8.  It loosened up after a hot shower a little, but not as well as it did yesterday.  There were certainly fewer instances of gasping pain today, but it was stiff and sore all day.  I took one Ibuprofen this morning which did not seem to work as well as the Tylenol yesterday.


## 2014-09-10

If Monday was a 10, I would say today in the morning my back was about a 6, but by the time I got to work it was an 8.  It might be because I am not as physically active today being in the office and not in the field.  I took 1 Advil before I left home.

My weight was 162.4 this morning.  My goal is to get to 160 and then keep it between 160 and 165 by watching my caloric intake.

Bruce Ward is in town to meet with some clients and his employees.

Joey had baseball practice last night, and Julie said he did well catching grounders and even caught a couple fly balls.  He showed improvement since the spring.  I stayed home with Tommy, fed him and read him a story before bed.  Tommy has practice on Thursday.

## Markdown Code Formatting {#id2201291602}

#2201291602 #python #markdown

OK, now it is today. Let us try some code formatting.

````markdown
```python
def the_truth():
    return "Joe Legner is cool."
```
````

```python
def the_truth():
    return "Joe Legner is cool."
```

How about a little math? Permutation of $n$ items taken $r$ ways:

```markdown
$$P(n, r) = \dfrac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$
```

$$P(n, r) = \dfrac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$

Brainstorm some ways this KB could be used:

- As a blog like these dated entries that creates searchable HTML file and PDF.

- As a set of pages on specific topics that get updated periodically.

## 2020-05-20

Today was a good day. I was able to create an Anki deck for Project Management Institute (PMI) glossary terms. It was kind of hard. The steps I took were.

1. Export the PDF pages to a text file.

2. Do a bunch of work in Vim to isolate the term from its definition. This ended up being pretty tough, but I eventually got it.

3. Convert the file to UTF-8. OK, now you're getting ridiculous. This was hard. Got it, though.

4. Import into Anki. This was the most straightforward part. They make it easy. I selected the "type-in answer" card type and mapped the first field (left of the ;) to the back side and the second field (right of the ;) to the first field. I'll be damned if it didn't work.

I also tried to use <Hugo.io> but did not like it. Since I converted my KB to this simple markdown and Pandoc-based system, I am spoiled. It's just too easy to use to switch to Hugo.

I took out the part of the kb Makefile that creates separate .pdf files for each article. Next I will split into two categories: articles and blog entries. Then I will build two PDFs: kb.pdf made up of articles and journal.pdf made up of blog entries.

## Convert a Text File to UTF-8 {#id2201290403}

#2201290403 #zsh #text

Here is how I converted to UTF-8:

## Individuals {#id2201291604}

#2201291604 #individuals #ontology

What if we stopped treating people as groups or even teams and started dealing with them as individuals? What if instead of credentials we sought skills?

Let's think of some skills. What about scheduling? There seem to be two skills involved in scheduling that are fairly tightly linked: (1) creating schedules with the Critical Path Method (CPM) and (2) using Primavera P6 software. One would think anyone having the 2nd skill would already have the first skill. I think at Tampa Electric there is reason to believe not many have a strong 1st skill: understanding CPM. We frequently see dead-end activities missing either a predecessor or successor or both.

## Calculus

I glanced over the beginning of the book _Calculus Made Easy_ by Silvanus P. Thompson (1918), and the introduction first got me laughing and then immediately made me realize this book might be great.

Link to the book:
<https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33283/33283-pdf.pdf>

The laugh came from this part:

> Considering how many fools can calculate, it is surprising that it should be thought either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to master the same tricks.

> Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics—and they are mostly clever fools—seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.

> Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.

The "Wow, this is good" came at this part:

> The preliminary terror, which chokes off most fifth-form boys from even attempting to learn how to calculate, can be abolished once for all by simply stating what is the meaning—in common-sense terms—of the two principal symbols that are used in calculating.

> These dreadful symbols are:

> (1) $d$ which merely means "a little bit of." Thus $dx$ means a little bit of $x$; or $du$ means a little bit of $u$.

> Ordinary mathematicians think it more polite to say "an element of," instead of "a little bit of." Just as you please. But you will find that these little bits (or elements) may be considered to be indefinitely small.

> (2) $\int$ which is merely a long S, and may be called (if you like) "the sum of." Thus $\int dx$ means the sum of all the little bits of $x$; or $\int dt$ means the sum of all the little bits of $t$. Ordinary mathematicians call this symbol "the integral of."

> Now any fool can see that if $x$ is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called $dx$, if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the $dx$’s, (which is the same thing as the _whole_ of $x$). The word "integral" simply means "the whole."

> If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may (if you like) think of it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.

## Energy Supply Conference Call

We had an Energy Supply (ES) WebEx today hosted by Dave Pickles, Jack Prestwood, Scott Cannon, and Chip Whitworth (VP and three directors).

## Images in the Journal

I created a subdirectory `images` under `journal` to put images. Here is an example of its use:

This Markdown input:

```markdown
![Anki Results](./images/anki_2020-05-22.png) Anki Results Today
```

Gives this output:

![Anki Results](./images/anki_2020-05-22.png) Anki Results Today

## 2020-05-23

## `newday.py`

I wrote a quick Python script to create a new Blog post entry every day. It will have to be run manually, but whatever.

```python
#!python3.8
import datetime
import os

JOURNAL_PATH = os.path.abspath("./journal")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set up the filename and path
    today_iso8601 = datetime.date.today().isoformat()
    filename = today_iso8601 + ".md"
    path_filename = os.path.join(JOURNAL_PATH, filename)
    print(path_filename)

    # Create the file if it does not exist
    if os.path.exists(path_filename):
        print("File already exists. Exiting.")
    else:
        print("Creating file %s" % path_filename)
        f = open(path_filename, 'a')
        f.write("# %s\n" % today_iso8601)
        f.close()
        assert os.path.exists(path_filename)
        print("Done.")
```

What else did I do today? I ran shortly after I got up. Recently I've only been running 1 to 1-1/2 miles. Today I ran 1-1/2. The problem I've encountered is that my knee hurts. Whenever I start running and one of my knees hurt, I stop running. I don't chance it. But then I might rest for a few days, and the next time I try to run my knee feels perfectly fine.

I need new shoes, too.

For lunch Julie made "loose meat sandwiches" a la Maid Rite.

## Oh My Zsh

Today I installed <https://ohmyz.sh/> and a few plugins:

```bash
plugins=(
  autopep8
  brew
  django
  dotenv
  git
  heroku
  pipenv
  pyenv
  pylint
  python
)
```

I also installed the theme <https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme> but later switched it back to the original one, `robbyrussell`.

## 2020-05-24 

## Sunday before Memorial Day

Trying an experiment where I give a title to each day. Tomorrow is Memorial Day, so if I was telling a story to someone, I could say, "it was on the Sunday before Memorial Day," and they would know the day I meant. I will try to make my titles be of this sort.

## Ideas for Computer Skills {#id2201291607}

#2201291607 #programming #development #skills #learning

Something I want to be is a Software Developer. To that end, I want to improve my abilities over time, even though I have not committed fully to this career change. So I have a Habitica goal to work for 15 minutes a day improving my skills.

For a few days in a row, I have not really thought up much to see, so I thought I could jot down a few ideas here to stir my imagination when I have another few free moments to look into something.

1. **Python Type Hints**. It think this might be a way to make Python safer. I should learn about it. There might be a Pycon presentation I could watch 15-20 minutes a day. I would need to keep track of where I was in the video or use bookmarks.

1. **Jupyter**. I learned a lot about this already. Maybe try doing something with it? Or maybe learn more? Or maybe set up a way to easily play around with them in the future like a perpetually running server?

1. **Design Patterns**. These might be worth memorizing, too. The ones for Python are probably best for me.

1. **Code Snippets**. Consider writing some code snippets for Python, Markdown.

1. **Javascript**. This also probably takes a course. I think I could pick it up quickly.

1. **Django**. I could always learn more about this. Some topics I am unclear about:

   A. Multi-tenant apps.

   B. Authentication.

   C. Generating and serving diagrams.

   D. Adding a Vue front end.

   E. Django REST Framework.

1. **Vue**. This probably deserves taking an entire course.

## A Definition of Project Management {#id2201291609}

#2201291609 #project-management

Here is an interesting if not lengthy definition of project management found in Kerzner (2017).

> Project management is the planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of company resources for a relatively short-term objective that has been established to complete specific goals and objectives. Furthermore, project management utilizes the systems approach to management by having functional personnel (the vertical hierarchy) assigned to a specific project (the horizontal hierarchy).

## Project Success {#id2201291611}

#2201291611 #project-management #objective #scope #schedule #budget

This is adapted from Kerzner (2017). A project should be considered successful if it achieves all of its objectives:

- within the allocated time period,

- within the budgeted cost,

- At the proper performance or specification level,

- with acceptance by the customer/user,

- with minimum or mutually agreed upon scope changes,

- without disturbing the main work flow of the organization; and,

- without changing the corporate culture.

Scope changes must be held to a minimum and those that are required must be approved by both the project manager and the customer/user.

## Project Management Success

From Kerzner (2017):

> Excellence in project management is defined as a continuous stream of successfully managed projects.

See [Project Success] for what it means to have a successfully managed project.

## Project Constraints {#id2201291612}

#2201291612 #project-management #constraint #planning #scope #schedule #budget #cost #quality

Again from Kerzner (2017):

> ...in Disneyland and Disneyworld, the project managers designing and building the attractions at the theme parks had six constraints: time, cost, scope, safety, aesthetic value, and quality.

Were I to adapt that to any of our projects, we would get:

1. Time

1. Cost

1. Scope

1. Safety

1. Quality

I deleted aesthetic value. What else could we substitute for it? How about operations value? How about business value? How about value to stakeholders? What about justification?

> At Disney, the last three constraints of safety, aesthetic value, and quality were considered locked-in constraints that could not be altered during trade-offs. All trade-offs were made on time, cost, and scope. Some constraints simply cannot change while others may have flexibility.

Which things would be sacrosanct? Certainly the last two: safety and quality. Right now quality does not seem to matter enough to worry about.

Constraints need not all be equal in importance. The most important constraint is the one we refuse to compromise by trade-offs. So this naturally excludes safety and quality, because we say we refuse trade-offs for them, too.

Could we ever have a trade-off between safety and quality? I don't think it's likely, because safety is probably subsumed by quality. Or if nothing else, they both point in the same general direction. We want the thing to be "good" and goodness by rights is going to include safety. High quality includes having a high degree of safety.

Let's take a stab at prioritizing our constraints as a general rule:

1. Safety
1. Business Value
1. Cost
1. Time
1. Quality
1. Scope

The way to think about these priorities is this: between any two ask yourself, "which of these would I not be willing to sacrifice to achieve the other?" Why did I order these this way?

In terms of a company that I would want to work for, I would want it to be one where we would never sacrifice safety for any other reason. Next is business value. The reason for _any_ project is to add business value: to reduce a risk or profit from an opportunity. So this must be second to safety, almost axiomatically.

The next four I am not as sure about. If they are not in a strict hierarchy, they seem to be _weighted_ in this order. Cost seems to be more important than time, generally speaking. Quality should be more important than cost and time, but I don't think it is for us. Scope should be subordinate to the others.

## Department Constraints {#id2201291620}

#2201291620 #management #constraint #resource

Could we adapt the project constraints to running the department?

1. **Requirements.** What is expected _of_ the department? What are we expected to contribute? How are we expected to behave? What functions do we perform for our customers?
1. **Stakeholders.** Who expects these things of our department? How do we know what they want? How do we make sure they approve of us?
1. **Communications.** What information should be passed around the department? What kind should be disseminated vertically or horizontally? Who does the communicating on various matters? What can I say?
1. **Resources.** What money, labor, skills, and equipment do we need to do whats required in a way that the stakeholders approve of?
1. **Constraints.** What forms the boundaries of what we are allowed to do? What limits our behaviors? What keeps us from doing certain actions? What is the right thing to when one comes in conflict with another?
   1. **Safety.** When faced with a decision, we should choose the option that has the greatest reduction in the probability of an injury.
   1. **Business Value.** We should only do things that have continued business justification: either capitalizing on an opportunity or reducing a risk.
   1. **Cost.** We should be cognizant of the costs of our decisions and work to minimize costs to the company in the long run.
   1. **Time.** We should try to do things as quickly as we can without sacrificing any other constraint.
   1. **Quality.** We should create things that are functional, durable, and reliable.
   1. **Scope.** We should maximize how much functionality we provide to our stakeholders.

## Results not Methods {#id2201291613}

#2201291613 #management #task #result #method

When delegating tasks, emphasize results, not methods. Provide suggestions on how to improve results. But do not dictate methods. This is easier on you and allows for people to distinguish themselves by their own initiative. You don't have to tell people how to do things. Just tell them what you want from their output. If it's not possible or needs more resources, they will tell you. Then you can decide if they are right and either provide the resources or alter your requirements.

The relationship at each level in the company hierarchy is like a contract. It requires that the lower level person provide certain contractually required services in return for a salary, benefits, and continued employment. What should this contract look like? I bet a collective bargaining agreement would be a good place to start.

As a department we could change our management philosophy to this. We first need to know what flows out of our department. This includes not only documents produced by us but demands put on the organization, such as money needed for our employees and operations. Once the outflows are identified, the directly affected stakeholders are identified. Next we talk to these stakeholders and find out what they want out of us. What are we doing well? What are we doing that's frustrating or counterproductive? Next set up sign-offs that connect stakeholder requirements to performance. The performance of a team member should be judged in terms of how much it provides value to our stakeholders, weighted according to the importance of the stakeholder.

The army requires leaders to receive training, education, and experience. I find it interesting how they split up training and education here. They are all related, right? Training is something like practicing to get better at skill. Education is learning to get better at a skill. Experience is the sum total of lessons learned executing a skill.

## 2020-05-25 Memorial Day

Today is Memorial Day, and I am off work. I got up around 7:00 am and reheated some coffee. Then I did my Duolingo practice and my Anki flashcards.

I went out to run at 8:00 am. Lately all I do is walk for 1/2 mile and then jog for 1-1/2 miles for a total of 2 miles. Today I walked 1/2 mile and started running. Three tenths of a mile into the run, my left knee starting feeling weird, hurting. I monitored it for a minute to see if it would go away, but when I rounded a corner it got worse, so I stopped running. I tried walking on it, and it was still hurting, so I slowly walked back home, in the grass to cushion my steps.

## Resources

I am still reading Kerzner today. Here is his list of all resources:

1. Money
2. Employees
3. Equipment
4. Facilities
5. Materials
6. Information/technology

As Kerzner (2017) puts it:

> When we say that project managers control project resources, we really mean that they control those resources (which are temporarily loaned to them) _through line managers_. (his emphasis)

Another way Kerzner states them in the same book on page 14:

1. Capital
2. Materials
3. Equipment
4. Facilities
5. Information
6. Personnel

## Interface Management

The Project Manager role must manage these relationships:

- Within the project team
- Between the project team and the functional organizations
- Between the project team and senior management
- Between the project team and the customer’s organization, whether an internal or external organization

## Projects as Lead-ins to Leadership

> The project manager is actually a general manager and gets to know the total operation of the company. In fact, project managers get to know more about the total operation of a company than most executives. That is why _project management is often used as a training ground to prepare future general managers who will be capable of filling top management positions_.

## Line Manager and Project Manager

Line managers are the real authority. Project managers derive authority from them, "borrowing" the line manager's resources as it were. A line manager should never act as a project manager, because it creates a conflict of interest. It will appear that they are giving priority to their own project.

## Types of Employees in Kerzner

- Line Manager
  - Negotiates with PM to deliver deliverables
  - Manages Functional Employee commitments
- Project Manager
  - Negotiates with LM for Deliverables
- Functional Employee
  - Does the work
  - Works for LM
  - Formally reports to LM
  - Informally reports to PM

The **Functional Employee** is expected to:

1. accept responsibility for accomplishing the assigned deliverables within the project’s constraints,
2. complete the work at the earliest possible time,
3. periodically inform both the project and line manager of the project’s status,
4. bring problems to the surface quickly for resolution; and,
5. share information with the rest of the project team.

## Governance

> Governance relates to decisions that define expectations, accountability, responsibility, the granting of power, or verifying performance. Governance relates to consist- ent management, cohesive policies, and processes and decision-making rights for a given area of responsibility. Governance enables efficient and effective decision making to take place.

## Project versus Corporate Governance

- **Alignment**: Corporate governance focuses on how well the portfolio of projects is aligned to and satisfies overall business objectives. Project governance focuses on ways to keep a project on track.

- **Direction**: Corporate governance provides strategic direction with a focus on how project success will satisfy corporate objectives. Project governance is more operation direction with decisions based upon the predefined parameters on project scope, time, cost, and functionality.

- **Dashboards**: Corporate governance dashboards are based upon financial, market- ing, and sales metrics. Project governance dashboards have operations metrics on time, cost, scope, quality, action items, risks, and deliverables.

- **Membership**: Corporate governance committees are composed of the seniormost levels of management. Project government membership may include some membership from middle management.

## Army Leadership Readings

The leader attributes are:

- Character

- Presence

- Intellect

## Collective Leaders

Collective leaders:

- Recognize that cohesive leadership has a greater impact than an individual leader has alone.

- Consciously contribute to unifying beliefs, attitudes, and actions up and down and across units.

- Concede personal power and control to subordinates, peers, and superiors when doing so will enhance a collective focus.

- Sacrifice self-interest and personal or unit accomplishments in favor of mutual goals.

- Create and groom relationships with others inside and outside the organization that contribute to advancing goals.

- Become aware of sources of expertise across a unit and draw on it when needed.

## Strengths and Limitations

Instead of saying strengths and weaknesses, say strengths and limitations.

## Coaching

When coaching, say things like, "OK, here's what I'm trying to do, and why what you did was not helpful." Or, "OK, what you did there was really good, because it aligns with something I'm trying to do. Let me explain it."

## Procedure Writing

Procedures should be written by the lowest possible level of the organization. Leadership should try to define what procedures are appropriate to write, in a certain order of priority, and should provide the tools and training necessary to write the procedure well.

We should start with our core processes.

## Garage Band Recording

Julie wanted to record her vocals singing I Wanna Dance with Somebody, so we got out GarageBand. I dragged over the backing audio tracks that her piano-playing friend Brandon sent over. I set the levels using myself as the sound source, and then handed the mic to Julie. She recorded her part in one take over top of the backing track. I exported it to a `wav` file and uploaded it to Google Drive.

## 2020-05-26 Tuesday After Memorial Day

I got up around 7:00 am but did not get fully situated until about 8:00 am at my home office desk. I am listening to a Lute/medieval music playlist on Spotify which is great. The music is not really repetitive. It's just like an endless stream of somebody good noodling on the lute, stream of consciousness style.

## Morning Routine

I have been working at home for about 9 weeks. My daily work routine is as follows:

1. Start the coffee, either in the Keurig machine or coffee maker, but usually the Keurig.

1. Get up, get dressed, take my medications, brush my teeth, and apply Scalpicin to my ears.

1. Start a new Berry Remote Team Daily Report Word document, changing the date and report number.

1. Read and process the emails leftover from the previous day, especially the COVID-19 updates from the company. Include relevant things of interest in the report agenda news section.

## Project Planning

These are the items that Kerzner (2017) says the PM brings to the table during planning:

- Complete task definitions
- Resource requirement definitions (possibly skill levels)
- Major timetable milestones
- Definition of end-item quality and reliability requirements
- The basis for performance measurement
- Definition of project success

Looking at this list, it looks like the kinds of things the Project Lead should be doing in the early stages of the project.

## Deliverables

Rather than managing by phases or any other such thing, we could simply manage projects by deliverables. Here I am using deliverables in an intentionally comprehensive way. It means defining all the work in terms of deliverables. This means not only the construction work and the engineering packages used for construction. It also means all the little deliverables that are _necessary_ to the completion of the project.

## Improper Administrative Planning

Kerzner talks about administrative planning. This means planning the policies, procedures, rules, guidelines, and directives that define how projects are administered. It's the ground rules for projects. This part gave me a chuckle when I read it, because it so reminds me of my experience at TECO right now.

> Improper project administrative planning can create a situation that requires:
>
> - A continuous revision and/or establishment of company and/or project policies, procedures, and directives
> - A continuous shifting in organizational responsibility and possible unnecessary restructuring
> - A need for staff to acquire new knowledge and skills

## Methodology

<https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/making-project-methodology-fit-guide-6085>

> A methodology is an appropriate, professional, repeatable, standardized, and documented collection of processes, tools, techniques, and templates for managing projects (Whitaker, 2012). The methodology is what you use to deliver your projects; it should reflect the size, complexity, and industry of your projects. It should be based on good practices, such as those in the PMBOK® Guide—Fourth edition. It should be easily located and understood by all project team members. It should also be subject to the process of continuous improvement to make sure it is kept up to date with any changes.

Another great website:
<https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/tailoring-benefits-project-management-methodology-11133>

## Design Patterns YouTube Video

Started watching this video which is over 3 hours long.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1FZ_Bd4DSM>

Patterns are discovered, not invented.

1. Idioms. These are the lowest-level patterns. They solve a particular problem in a particular language.

1. Design patterns. These are solutions to recurring problems that are usually language-independent but oriented to a particular paradigm. Paradigms include object-oriented programming and functional programming.

1. Architectural patterns. This is the highest-level pattern. The big picture of the system and how its components interact. This could be something to research.

## Indexing During Iteration

When we have a list or tuple and want to iterate over its members but also know the item number, how do we do it? Here's the right way (idiom) to do this:

```python
for index, value in enumerate(collection):
    print(index, value)
```

## 2020-05-27 Wednesday

## Scope

A scope is a quantity. It is a mathematical set where the elements are all the work products in the project. The types of the work products are also elements in a set of project-specific deliverable _types_. Each type should be matched to a written standard. Then each member of the project-specific deliverables should be created with and judged against the written standard.

## Projects, Deliverables, and Standards

Let **department projects** be the set of projects that are being worked on by department team members. Each project shall deliver at least one deliverable.

Let **scope** be the entire set of deliverables (instances, not types) in the project.

Let **tasks** be the actions needed to produce the items in the scope.

Let **activity** be the intersection of a subset of tasks and a deliverable.

Let **activities** be the set of activities.

Let **schedule** be the intersection of the activities with the calendar.

Let **stakeholder register** be the set of persons and groups that affects or is affected by the activities.

Let the **external scope** be the intersection between the scope and the stakeholder register.

Let **project deliverable types** be the set of different _kinds_ of deliverables in a project.

Let **deliverable types** be the set of all possible types of deliverables.

Let **department standards** be the set of standards that define each deliverable type in the deliverable types set.

Each project deliverable should include a reference back to its governing standard.

For each deliverable type in the deliverable types set there shall be one and only one department standard which defines the requirements for the deliverable. Each standard may define one or more deliverable types.

## Python Generator

This is a new concept I've not seen. Let's look at a list comprehension.

```python
g = [i * i for i in range(10)]
```

Running this will output `[0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]`. But if we instead put the expression in parentheses we get a _generator_.

```python
g = (i * i for i in range(10))
```

This thing is neat. What it does is meters out the elements using the `next()` function or the remaining items in the generator. For example:

```python
>>> g = (i * i for i in range(10))
>>> next(g) # first element
0
>>> next(g) # second element
1
>>> list(g) # remaining elements
[2, 4, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

## 2020-05-29 Friday Off

I took off a Friday for the first time in awhile. In fact, I still have carry-over PTO from last year. I charged 8 hours today. I got up maybe 8:00 am and went for a walk/run of a total of 1.5 miles. I also approved timecards, except for Carl Williams' whose was not ready by my 12:00 noon deadline.

## Organization of Blog Posts

Here is a proposed outline of my blog posts:

- A blurb about the day. Not a long dissertation, just enough to kind of tell the reader what kind of day it was with maybe enough facts to pinpoint it in time.

- A series of Level 2 (`##` in Markdown) sub-sections on topics of the day. These topics are purpose of the blog. I hope to benefit from searching, skimming, and reading them.

Today's entry follows this pattern. It starts with the blurb about me taking a Friday off and proceeds into the first Level 2 subject: [Organization of Blog Posts].

## Project Management Maturity Model

Here is a figure from Kerzner (2017). The green checks show where we are as of today, in my opinion. We have a ways to go.

![Project Management Maturity Model](images/pm-maturity-model.png)

## Project Management

Project management may be defined as the process of achieving project objectives through the traditional organizational structure and over the specialties of the individuals concerned. Project management is applicable for any ad hoc (unique, one-time, one-of-a- kind) undertaking concerned with a _specific end objective_.

In order to complete a task[^taskobj], a project manager must:

- Set objectives starting with the specific end objective

- Establish plans

- Organize resources including staffing

- Set up controls

- Issue directives

- Motivate personnel

- Apply innovation for alternative solutions

- Remain flexible

[^taskobj]: objective

## Maturity in Project Management

Here is a definition from Kerzner:

> Maturity in project management is the implementation of a standard methodology and accompanying processes such that there exists a high likelihood of repeated successes.

Notice the use of the word _methodology_.

> This definition is supported by the life-cycle phases shown in Table 2–1. Maturity implies that the proper foundation of tools, techniques, processes, and even culture, exists. when projects come to an end, there is usually a debriefing with senior management to discuss how well the methodology was used and to recommend changes. This debriefing looks at "key performance indicators," which are shared learning topics, and allows the organization to maximize what it does right and to correct what it did wrong.

Excellence for Kerzner seems to be the optimization of performance resulting from years of project management maturity.

> Organizations excellent in project management are those that create the environment in which there exists a continuous stream of successfully managed projects and where success is measured by what is in the best interest of both the company and the project (i.e., customer).

![Project Management Maturity and Excellence](images/maturity-excellence.png)

Our first objective should be maturity, then excellence.

## Python Type-Checking

From this video by Carl Meyer `@carljm`: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMgmKJyWKn8>

The point of type-checking Python is based upon these principles:

1. Reading code is work.

2. Adding code for type-checking is work.

3. Skimming type definitions is _less work_ than reading code. (#1)

4. Duck-typing requires you to read the code to figure out the contract between caller and function. "What does it walk like?"

5. Type-checking does not required you to read the code. You just skim the type definitions.

6. Code is written once and maintained indefinitely. There is a large asymmetry: maintenance happens more than writing.

7. We want to select the alternative with the minimum work:

   A. Rely upon traditional duck-typing.

   B. Include type-checking when written.

8. We should select option B - Type Checking, because of #3, #5, and #6.

### How to Type-Check in Python

Code without type checking:

```python
def square(x):
    return x*x
```

Add type-checking:

```python
def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x*x
```

The type checking code consists of the `: int` part after the variable `x` and the `-> int` notation. The first indicates that the argument `x` must be an integer. The other part indicates that the function will return an integer.

We will need a **static type-checker**. The most commonly used one today is maintained by Dropbox and is called mypy. See <http://mypy-lang.org/>.

To initiate a variable as an empty list of strings:

```python
self.tags: List[str] = []
```

However, you should focus on type-annotating function signatures and only annotate variables if the type-checker asks you to do it.

### Union

A union is a way to let a function return more than one type.

```python
from typing import Union

def get_foo_or_bar(id: int) -> Union[Foo, Bar]:
    ...

def get_foo_or_none(id: int) -> Union[Foo, None]:
    ...
```

The second one is very common. It's so common that they made a separate type annotation for it called `Optional`.

```python
from typing import Optional

def get_foo_or_none(id: int) -> Optional[Foo]: # same as Union[Foo, None]
    ...
```

### Overload Decorator

However, you should _avoid_ using `Union` and `Optional` as return types. Instead you should use the `overload` decorator.

```python
from typing import Optional, overload

@overload
def get_foo(foo_id: None) -> None:
    pass

@overload
def get_foo(foo_id: Int) -> Foo:
    pass

def get_foo(foo_id: Optional[int]) -> Optional[Foo]:
    ...

```

### Generic Functions

Instead of the overload decorator, we can also define a `TypeVar` which consists of two or more different types. The way it works is this. If you annotate an argument and return value as the same `TypeVar` the type-checker will ensure that input and output is of the same type.

```python
from typing import TypeVar

AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)

def concat(a: AnyStr, b: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:
    return a + b

concat('foo', b'bar')                # typecheck error
reveal_type(concat('foo', 'barr'))   # str
reveal_type(concat(b'foo', b'bar'))  # bytes
```

Note that `AnyStr` happens to come pre-defined in `mypy` (I guess).

### Gradual Typing

Gradual typing is for when you have an existing code base and want to introduce type-checking. It operates based upon one simple rule: **type-check only annotated functions.**

### MonkeyType

MonkeyType is a Python system to detect types by watching a Python module run and then apply type annotations accordingly. Refer to its website.

## `fswatch`

I added a script to my KB project that watches two directories and calls the `make.sh` script when it detects a file change. The use case is to start the `fswatch` instance and then edit the `.md` source files. Every time I save with `CTRL+s` the `./make.sh` script will run.

It works! Here is my initial script code

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
echo Watching journal/ and pages/...
fswatch -0 ./journal ./pages | xargs -0 -I {} zsh make.sh
```

So far it has one page: <blog.kissyfacetown.com>.

## Breakdown of a Project

From top to bottom:

- Program

- Project

- Sub-Project

- Work Package

- Task/Activity

## Project Charter

I looked at a book today called _Project Management Basics - How to Manage Your Project with Checklists_ by Melanie McBride (2016). It taught me something right off the bat! It said this:

> According to the PMBOK, the project charter is solely owned by the project sponsor, and it specifically authorizes the project manager to utilize resources to execute the project.

What's this mean for TECO? Well, our support request form is the closest thing we have. I would rather have all business units use a common Project Initiation Form, but instead we will have to rely on the stations reaching out to OPM. That's the support request form. There's one thing that's missing though: change control.

We need a way to control changes to the Support Request Form (a/k/a Project Charter). We should have a versioning system. The first version that is submitted to us is Rev. 0. After that, any change is given a numerical revision increase. More than one text change can occur within one revision. A revision is just a set of changes all made at the same time. When a revision is published, there should not be any other outstanding changes.

I don't understand the PMI fixation on Project Charters. Here is a document that the Project Manager is supposed to be handed. But the PM is not involved at this point. Why bother to teach her what should go into a Project Charter? She cannot control what goes in it. It must be given to her. Instead we should broaden our definition and allow that a Project Charter is any written authorization to start a project. It could be a purchase order. It could be an email saying, "please start a project to produce a new X." It could be anything. I suppose it should be written, but apart from that who cares.

## Checklist

Let's try to do a checklist using Markdown and see how Pandoc handles it.

- [ ] This is a to-do item.
- [x] This is a completed to-do item.

The code for this is:

```
- [ ] This is a to-do item.
- [x] This is a completed to-do item.
```

I'm going to try this in my TECO team repository. Maybe I could invent a system of checklists to keep us out of trouble. I wonder what it looks like when we do the `.md` to `.docx` conversion.

## 2020-05-30 Saturday

I don't normally take off a Friday like I did yesterday. Today is Saturday. I made a pot of coffee and did my Duolingo Spanish lessons and Anki cards. So far today as of 8:46 am, I've spent 17 minutes studying 105 cards.

## Categories of Project Failure

Kerzner (2017, p. 54) defines failure simply as "unmet expectations." I would re-phrase this as:

> Failure is the condition when performance is less than expected. $P < E$.

A _planning failure_ is when we set expectations that cannot be achieved.

$$\text{Planning Failure: }P < E_{unachievable}$$

An _actual failure_ is when performance is sub-standard, but the expectations were achievable.

$$\text{Actual Failure: }P < E_{achievable}$$

Let $\Delta_p = E_{unachievable} - P$ and $\Delta_a = E_{achievable} - P$.

The _perceived failure_ is the net sum of _actual failure_ and _planning failure_. The perceived failure will be unfair when expectations exceed what is achievable. It will be fair when the expectations and what is achievable are the same.

## Risk Management

Kerzner (2017) says **risk management** is the key to avoiding planning errors:

> ...we believe that the major component of planning failure is inappropriate or inadequate risk management, or having a project management methodology that does not provide any guidance for risk management.

Section 2.9 of Kerzner gives a nice checklist of project failure causes. Use this as a checklist for developing our project delivery methodology.

## Project Methodology: The OPM Way

What if we branded our department project management methodology "The OPM Way"? It would give unity to the system by having one name. It would promote our department by name every time it is mentioned.

> "How do you guys manage to hit your schedule targets all the time? We are usually late."

> "The OPM Way says to use historical results rather than guesses."

> "I see. And what is the OPM Way? How do you track the historical results and use them to plan new schedules?"

## The Stage-Gate Process

Refer to Kerzner (2017, p. 60).

> When companies recognize the need to begin developing processes for project management, the starting point is normally the stage-gate process.

The process is composed of _stages_ and _gates_. A stage is a group of activities that can be run in series or parallel. At the end of each stage is a decision point: a gate that either allows the team to proceed or prevents them from proceeding until the work of the current stage is acceptable.

> A good corporate methodology for project management will provide checklists, forms, and guidelines to make sure that critical steps are not omitted.

But we should set it up so the Project Leads (a/k/a Project Manager in this context) are not the gatekeepers:

> Project managers are never allowed to function as their own gatekeepers. The gatekeepers are either individuals (i.e., sponsors) or groups of individuals designated by senior management and empowered to enforce the structured decision-making process.

## Checklists

A good checklist should focus on answering these questions (Kerzner 2017, p. 60):

- Where are we today (i.e., time and cost)?
- Where will we end up (i.e., time and cost)?
- What are the present and future risks?
- What assistance is needed from management?

## Gatekeeper Decisions

- Proceed to the next gate based upon the original objectives
- Proceed to the next gate based upon revised objectives
- Delay making a gate decision until further information is obtained
- Cancel the project

## Lifecycle Phases

There are no agreed-upon standards for the lifecycle phases of a project or product.

![Life-Cycle Phase Definitions (Kerzner 2017)](images/life-cycle-phases.png)

## 2020-05-31 Cornish Pasties

The big event today was Cornish pasties. Julie made this culinary dish with Tommy's and my help. The pasties are little folded-over dough circles stuffed with chopped chuck steak, potatoes, carrots, and onions. The dough is very simple, too: just flour, butter, and water. She spent a few hours doing the prep work which included making the dough and chilling it all night. She had to dice up all the meat, a carrot, and a potato. Then she rolled out the dough into 1/8" thick circles about 6" in diameter. I helped her by scooping about 1/3 cup of the filling into each one. Then she folded it over and sealed it with water and by crimping with a fork.

They turned out great. The crust was flaky and just right. The filling was tasty, but not flavorful. I added hot sauce (Cholula and Sriracha). We also tried dipping a piece in ketchup. That was good, too.

## Project Management Methodology

Achieving project management excellence, or maturity, is more likely with a repetitive process that can be used on each and every project. This repetitive process is referred to as the **project management methodology.**

> A project management methodology is a repetitive process used on each project and continually improved.

We should have two kinds of methodologies. We already do, sort of, because we do in fact manage these kinds of projects differently.

1. Projects that deliver what we set out to. This includes studies with well-defined outcomes. We could call these "closed-ended scope projects."

2. Projects where we don't know what we are going to deliver. This includes studies that are open-ended or exploratory. We could call these "open-ended scope projects."

## Project Changes

The way project changes should go is this:

1. The sponsor comes up with an idea to change a project requirement after the project has started.

2. OPM receives the change request and evaluates it.

3. OPM responds to the sponsor with a clear list of tradeoffs between making the change and not making the change.

4. The sponsor commits to the change or cancels it.

5. OPM documents the decision and proceeds as directed.

## Project Playbook Definition

The definition of the OPM Project Playbooks is "the enterprise project management methodology." Or, conversely, the name of the enterprise project management methodology is the Project Playbook. It is a repetitive process used on each project and continually improved.

Requirements of the playbook per Kerzner (2017, p. 70):

- Not too abstract and high level.

- Contains sufficient narratives to support the methodology.

- Functional and addresses all areas.

- Follows industry standards and best practices. Uses standard terminology.

- Is really integrated into the business processes.

- Uses standard project conventions and terminology.

- Has performance metrics.

- Are not too demanding from an administrative and bureaucratic perspective.

- Deviation should be acceptable when the assumptions have changed.

- The assumptions should be stated.

- Out of the box ideas should be encouraged.

- Allows value-added changes.

- Is tailored to the complexity and importance of the project.

- Not rushed. Enough time is spent on it to bring it down to the working level, not the abstract level.

- Considers bottlenecks and concerns of the user community. The user community to us is the three stations.

- Not too detailed.

- Does not take that long to use. Takes less time than we save by all the problems caused when we do not use it.

- Simple enough for our particular situation and clients.

- Has enough good metrics.

## Change Management Methodology

We should also have a Change Management Methodology.

Change should be managed by doing the following:

- Explaining the reasons for the change and soliciting feedback
- Explaining the desired outcomes and rationale
- Championing the change process
- Empowering the appropriate individuals to institutionalize the changes
- Investing in training necessary to support the changes

## 2020-06-01 Ostrofsky's Birthday

Today is David Ostrofsky's birthday. Tomorrow is my brother Ron's birthday. He was born in 1964 which makes him 56 in 2020, nine years my elder. David is 39 today which makes him 8 years my junior.

## Agile

Agile appears to be an iterative methodology to develop software. However, Kerzner (2017) seems to be talking about it as a general project management methodology. According to Kerzner (p. 77):

> Agile project management practices have demonstrated that project management tailoring can work. Most methodologies today are made of forms, guidelines, templates, and checklists. The project manager then selects what is appropriate for a particular client and creates a flexible methodology or framework that can be unique for each client. we live in a world of adaptive environments. This is particularly important for external clients that would prefer that the framework be adapted to their business model and way of doing business rather than how your parent company does business. Framework success can lead to repeat business.

![Project Management (PM) Benchmarking from Kerzner (2017)](images/pm-benchmarking.png)

## Systems Approach

Kerzner (2017):

> The systems approach may be defined as a logical and disciplined process of problem solving. The word process indicates an active ongoing system that is fed by input from its parts. The systems approach:
>
> - Forces review of the relationship of the various subsystems
> - Is a dynamic process that integrates all activities into a meaningful total system
> - Systematically assembles and matches the parts of the system into a unified whole
> - Seeks an optimal solution or strategy in solving a problem

## Enterprise Project Management Methodology

Kerzner (2017) talks about Enterprise Project Management Methodology or EPM. In one of his case studies on pp. 86-87, he sets out in rough outline the steps that were taken.

1. Establish the number of life-cycle phases. They selected six. Others had recommended 10 or 12, but the time commitment for that many meetings was excessive.

2. Decide whether the methodology should be designed around rigid policies and procedures or the more informal route of forms, guidelines, checklists, and templates. They chose the informal approach.

3. See what could be salvaged from existing templates and checklists. The company had a few, but not all PMs used them. The PMs get to choose from among the tools available, which were all standardized in accordance with the _PMBOK Guide_.

4. Develop a means for capturing best practices using the EPM system.

5. Training.

## Reflecting

Every so often I should re-read these blog entries with a view toward:

1. Capturing action items

2. Transferring writing to other destinations

## Lean Project Management

Lean focuses on delivering more value with less waste. It does this by observing the following three principles:

- Muda – Remove everything that doesn’t add value to the customer
- Mura – Standardize for clarity
- Muri – Remove distractions and work at the optimal pace

For example, if you followed the lean project management methodology, you’d remove any unnecessary processes like revisions by focusing on the task at hand. You could standardize your project statements to streamline the process.

And finally, you’d reduce the number of projects you’re working on simultaneously to deliver higher quality work.

## 2020-06-02 Ron's Birthday

My brother Ron turns 56 years old today. He was born in Pontiac, Illinois in 1964.

## Total Quality Management

- [ ] I should look up and read about Total Quality Management (TQM) sometime.

## Authority, Responsibility, and Accountability

**Authority** is the power granted to individuals (possibly by their position) so that they can make final decisions.

**Responsibility** is the obligation incurred by individuals in their roles in the formal organization to effectively perform assignments.

**Accountability** is being answerable for the satisfactory completion of a specific assignment. (Accountability = authority + responsibility)

## 2020-06-03 Julie Put Her Phone Away

Today I noticed Julie's phone was sitting on my desk by my computer while I was working. I offered it to her, and she declined, saying she wanted to put it away. Thinking it was wise to do that, too, I dropped it. But she was sullen all morning. I finally asked her to come in and talk to me. I asked her what this was all about. She started crying. She is fed up with it all. She is so torn right now, because she thrives on contact with people, and with the Coronavirus pandemic going on, she is not getting that contact. Her only outlet is Facebook. But now she cannot even enjoy that. When she drops in to check on people she likes, she gets drawn into drama over and over again.

The last straw today was about a kind of meek and nice guy who plays piano in New Orleans. He posted something seemingly harmless and uplifting about people needing to take time to take care of themselves. He apparently got lambasted by at least one other person with 5 consecutive comments accusing him of being racist and mocking his discomfort. This was all from another white person by the way. Being a gentle soul, the guy was mortified to see people had been offended rather than comforted. So he took down the post. But the harassment apparently continued with screen shots of the guy's post! This crap is pretty standard on social media today. I have stopped participating for a few weeks.

I'm perfectly fine. But Julie is not. She is lost. She cannot play music in public, and she is getting blowback for that too. She cannot do music online, because why would people tune in when live music is back at bars? She cannot check up on her friends on Facebook for fear of getting upset seeing the shit storm that is Facebook. She cannot see her girlfriends, because they are all afraid of COVID-19. I am trying to help by spending more time with her and hopefully being more patient.

I put her phone on the charger. She came in at about 5:45 and laid face down on the bed and fell right asleep.

## Hillsborough County COVID Survey

Hillsborough County (I hate typing Hillsborough) issued a survey, and I completed it today. I answered that I was not comfortable sending my child back to school this fall. Here is the comment I added:

> Many experts are predicting a resurgence of the virus this fall. Until and unless a vaccine is developed or the virus completely runs its course, it seems unwise to expose thousands of children to the potential to pick up this dreaded virus. The effects of the virus are not fully understood. Permanent effects like loss of taste and neurological effects have been reported. Do we really want our kids to catch this? What better (worse) place to pick up a virus than a school? Take all that money you will save on building maintenance and re-appropriate it toward virtual schools.

## Matrix Organizational Form

Refer to Kerzner (2017, p. 95).

![Typical Matrix Organization Structure](images/matrix-org.png)

## 2020-06-04 Social Media Depression

Julie is suffering from depression right now. It's not as acute as it was when her mom died, but it is real and significant. She stopped looking at social media yesterday. Today she got on a game that she has where a little team does puzzles to contribute to a team score. She is one of the highest scorers on the team. She messaged them and said something to the effect, "I am emotionally drained and will not be playing the game much today. I will catch up this weekend." One of the team members gave her a hard time about it, saying something like, "I guess there are no black people on this list" and mocking her depression. This was enough to defeat what remaining spirit she still had.

The obnoxious player, "Dre", was summarily fired from the team by the captain who goes by the moniker, "Nobody." Incidentally, this leads to weird sentences like, "Nobody fired him from the team." Nobody also said some nice and encouraging things. He is a retired cop.

I feel bad for her. She was standing by the stove, and I walked up and held her. She was crying. I said, "I'm sorry you are going through this." She said, "But you can't fix it." I said, "No, but I can hold you." She seemed to like that.

## Josh Alston

Josh texted me today and was telling me about his big \$47M project up in Gainesville. He is working for a General Contractor now as a Project Manager. He lamented about a few sketchy things the company does to make 9% profit. But mostly he seemed pretty happy.

The project is a multi-story podium style structure, meaning it is one-story concrete with wood-framed floors above that. The project boasts features like some pools, and the concrete structure will be post-tensioned, something I've never worked with.

## Duolingo

Today I started three new lessons: Traditions, Social, and Memories. I had finished Restaurant 3 and Recreation 3 yesterday. As of today, I have learned 1,919 Spanish words, earning 37,616 XP. I have four followers, but only one is active: Julie, who just started learning Dutch this week. My achievements include Sage (30,000 XP), Regal (100 crowns), Sharpshooter (100 lessons with no mistakes), Strategist (read a tip), Friendly (followed 3 people), Weekend Warrior (completed a lesson on Saturday and Sunday), and Photogenic (added a profile picture).

![Three New Duolingo Lessons](images/traditions-social-memories2.png)

## Project Engineer versus Project Manager

![Project Management Compared to Project Engineering](images/pm-project-eng.png)

According to Kerzner (2017, p. 101), a weak project management organization is one where the line manager has more influence than does the project manager. This is _definitely_ the case at OPM and TECO.

But Kerzner adds that a PM with a stronger mastery of technical skills than line managers will make for a strong matrix structure. This is because front-line employees will look to the PM first, not the line managers.

## Stakeholder Identification Methods

### Rapid Listing

Rapid listing
One of the quickest and most robust techniques for identifying stakeholders at the start is to:

- Gather the core team together.

- Clarify the meaning of ‘stakeholder’ on the change and why it is important that the team does not miss anyone.

- Get each individual to make a rapid personal list of everyone they can think of, giving them about three minutes to do this.

- Pair people off and ask them to compare their lists, adding new stakeholders as they occur to them.

- Move these pairs into groups of four and repeat the last step.

- Finally ask the whole team to make a joint list. This works well as a technique because it exploits the creativity of groups and word association.

## German Food

We ordered and picked up food from Taste of Berlin in Brandon on Oakfield Drive. I got rindergoulash which was marinated pieces of steak over spaetzle with red cabbage, and I got an order of potato salad, too. Joey got the bratwurst. I'm not sure what Julie and Tommy ordered.

## Supplement: The Ladies

After dinner, around 7:00 pm, Julie went over to her friend Heather's porch and Tiffanie met them there. She needed to get away and chat with the ladies. We texted 2 or 3 times, and then I did not hear from her again until she rolled into the house before dawn. I know it was after 2:40 am and before 6:00 am, guessing around 5:00. I'm sure it was therapeutic and much-needed interaction.

## 2020-06-05 Challenge Team Video

Today I had to record a video for the first every TECO Challenge Team. This is a task force I got invited to which includes 11 people. The Vice President sponsor is Rene Gallant. The video is to introduce a series of interviews to ask people for ideas how to change the company after COVID-19. Here is the text I had to read:

> The world has experienced massive change at all levels. Whether we've felt prepared for them or not, we have all felt the impacts of those changes. We're in this together. An together, we can shape our future in ways we might not have imagined before. We'd like to hear from you. Let's challenge the way we've don business, challenge the status quo. Please, take a few moments and envision with us long term change that we might all embrace. Connect with us at ChallengeUS@tecoenergy.com. We're building tomorrow, today.

We have access to professional videographer. They are going to splice together our readings so it switches quickly from one person to another.

## 2020-06-06 Our First Gun

Today we picked up our revolver. It is a Smith and Wesson .357 with a laser sight and night sights. It was pouring down rain when we walked out of the store.

## ISO 9001-2008 Quality Management Systems

This is a standard that promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing, and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system (QMS), to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements.

In ISO 9001, **a process**:

1. is comprised of an activity or a set of linked activities,

1. uses resources,

1. is managed; and,

1. transforms inputs into outputs.

A **process approach** is the application of a system of processes, together with the identification and interactions of these processes, and their management to produce the desired outcome.

What is important is to:

1. understand requirements,

1. meet requirements,

1. consider processes in terms of value added,

1. obtain results of performance using objective measurement; and,

1. continually improve based upon objective measurement.

This is essentially the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) methodology.

![Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)](images/pdca.png)

- Plan: establish the objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with customer requirements and the organization's policies.
- Do: implement the processes.
- Check: monitor and measure processes and product against policies, objectives and requirements for the product and report the results.
- Act: take actions to continually improve process performance.

> ...customers play a significant role in defining requirements as inputs.

This implies we need to know who our customers are and find out what they want.

ISO 9001:2008 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization:

> a) needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide product that meets customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and \
> b) aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for continual improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

## ISO 9001 Requirements

The organization shall:

1. [ ] determine the processes[^iso9001proc] needed for the quality management system and their application throughout the organization,
1. [ ] determine the sequence and interaction of these processes,
1. [ ] determine criteria and methods needed to ensure that both the operation and control of these processes are effective,
1. [ ] ensure the availability of resources and information necessary to support the operation and monitoring of these processes,
1. [ ] monitor, measure where applicable, and analyze these processes, and
1. [ ] implement actions necessary to achieve planned results and continual improvement of these processes.

The **quality management system documentation** shall include:

1. [ ] documented statements of a quality policy and quality objectives,
1. [ ] a quality manual,
1. [ ] documented procedures and records required by this International Standard; and,
1. [ ] documents, including records, determined by the organization to be necessary to ensure the effective planning, operation and control of its processes.

The organization shall establish and maintain a **quality manual** that includes

1. [ ] the scope of the quality management system, including details of and justification for any exclusions,
1. [ ] the documented procedures established for the quality management system, or reference to them, and
1. [ ] a description of the interaction between the processes of the quality management system.

Documents (except records) required by the quality management system shall be controlled. A documented[^iso9001doccontrol] procedure shall be established to define the controls needed:

1. [ ] to approve documents for adequacy prior to issue,
1. [ ] to review and update as necessary and re-approve documents,
1. [ ] to ensure that changes and the current revision status of documents are identified,
1. [ ] to ensure that relevant versions of applicable documents are available at points of use,
1. [ ] to ensure that documents remain legible and readily identifiable,
1. [ ] to ensure that documents of external origin determined by the organization to be necessary for the planning and operation of the quality management system are identified and their distribution controlled, and
1. [ ] to prevent the unintended use of obsolete documents, and to apply suitable identification to them if they are retained for any purpose.

[^iso9001doccontrol]: Document control procedure for documents and records.
[^iso9001proc]: Management activities, provision of resources, product realization, measurement, analysis and improvement.

**Records** established to provide evidence of conformity to requirements and of the effective operation of the quality management system shall be controlled.

The organization shall establish a **documented procedure**[^iso9001doccontrol] to define the controls needed for:
the

- [ ] identification,
- [ ] storage,
- [ ] protection,
- [ ] retrieval,
- [ ] retention; and,
- [ ] disposition of records.

- [ ] Records shall remain legible, readily identifiable and retrievable.

## ISO 9000 and 9001 Definitions

ISO 9000 provides the terminology for quality systems. I downloaded it from LibGen today. It is in my Apple Books now.

> **customer**\
> person or organization that could or does receive a product or a service that is intended for or required by this person or organization.\
> EXAMPLE:Consumer, client, end-user, retailer, receiver of product or service from an internal process (3.4.1), beneficiary and purchaser.
> Note 1 to entry: A customer can be internal or external to the organization.

We can quickly tailor this to OPM.

**customer**\
organization that receives a service required by this organization.\
Note 1 to entry: Our customer is internal to the organization.

We provide both products and services. Products include electronic and paper documents (drawings, specifications, manuals, emails, and reports), materials, and equipment. Services we provide include:

- Project management
  - Planning
  - Executing
  - Monitoring and controlling
  - Closing
- Outage management
  - Planning
  - Executing
  - Monitoring and controlling
  - Closing
- Construction management
  - Planning
  - Executing
  - Monitoring and controlling
  - Closing
- Professional services (internal)
  - Electrical engineering
  - Structural engineering
  - Mechanical engineering
  - Process engineering
- External professional services management
  - Geotechnical engineering
  - Environmental engineering
  - Electrical engineering
  - Structural engineering
  - Mechanical engineering
  - Process engineering
- Internal professional services coordination
  - Environmental (TEC)
- Procurement
  - Engineering
  - Materials
  - Equipment
  - Services
    - Engineering
    - Construction
    - Other professional

**outsourced process** is a process that the organization needs for its quality management system and which the organization chooses to have performed by an external party.

## 2020-06-07 Walked to Starbucks

Today is Sunday. We got up around 8:30 am, got ready, and walked up to Starbucks. They would not let us in the building, because of COVID-19. Julie did a mobile order, and we both got lattes. I got a sausage and cheddar breakfast sandwich. It's good, but it is 500 kcal. It has been raining pretty much constantly. We had our phones in a Ziplock bag in case of rain. It did sprinkle just a little, but not enough to worry about. We counted only five (5) people walking or running during our 2-mile walk which is very low, owing to the weather no doubt.

## Another Project Resources List

Here is another resource list from Kerzner (2017, p. 118):

- Time (schedule)
- Manpower
- Money
- Facilities
- Equipment
- Material
- Information/technology

## Project Manager Qualities

From Kerzner (2017, p. 120):

> These qualities can be split into characteristics and skills. Project manager’s characteristics will in many cases determine how they will deploy their skills. examples of the characteristics which help to form good leaders in construction project management are:
>
> - Integrity
> - Preferred leadership style (tending towards democratic)
> - Self-confidence
> - Ability to delegate and trust others
> - Ability to cope with stress decisiveness judgment
> - Consistency and stability
> - Personal motivation and dedications determination > - Positive thinking
> - Excellent health
> - Openness and the ability to hear what others say
> - Ease in social interactions with many types of people
>
> In terms of _skills_, the following are important:
>
> - Persuasive ability
> - Negotiation skills
> - Commercial expertise
> - Political awareness
> - Breadth of vision
> - Integrative skills
> - Ability to set clear objectives
> - Communication skills
> - Management of meetings
> - Early warning antennae
> - Skills of diplomacy
> - The skill of discriminating important information

According to Kerzner, managers must understand for employees to perform efficiently:

> - They must know what they are supposed to do.
> - They must have a clear understanding of authority and its limits.
> - They must know what their relationship with other people is.
> - They should know what constitutes a job well done in terms of specific results.
> - They should know where and when they are falling short.
> - They must be made aware of what can and should be done to correct unsatisfactory results
> - They must feel that their superior has an interest in them as individuals.
> - They must feel that their superior believes in them and wants them to succeed.

My boss struggles with all of these, to put it mildly.

## System Definition

This is taken from David Hoyle (2017) _ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook_, page 110:

> **A comprehensive definition of a system**\
> System – A recognizable whole which consists of a set of interdependent parts. More specifically:
>
> a) A system is an assembly of components connected together in an organized way;\
> b) The components are affected by being in the system, and the behavior of the system is changed if they leave;\
> c) This assembly of components does something;\
> d) This assembly as a whole has been identified by someone who is interested in it.

## Customer Satisfaction Definition

This comes from Hoyle (2017, p. 747):

> By combining definitions of the terms customer satisfaction and requirement , ISO 9000:2015 defines customer satisfaction as **the customer’s perception of the degree to which the customer's stated or implied needs or expectations have been fulfilled.**

## Steps to Measure Customer Satisfaction

### What Measures?

- Repeat orders: These data can be collected from the order processing process
- Competition: These data are more subjective and result from market research.
- Referrals: These data can be captured from sales personnel during the transaction or later follow-up calls.
- Demand: These data can be collected from sales trends.
- Effects of product transition: These data can be collected from sales trends following new product launch.
- Surveys: These data can be collected from survey reports.
- Focus meetings: These data can be collected from the meeting reports.
- Complaints: These data can be collected from complaints recorded by customers or by staff on speaking with customers.
- Compliments: These data can be collected from written compliments sent in by customers or by staff on speaking with customers.

### Using a Survey

1. Identify the customer’s requirements (needs and expectations).
2. Determine a representative sample of customers.
3. Determine which type of survey is appropriate.
4. Design the questionnaire.
5. Conduct the survey.
6. Analyze the data.
7. Present the results.
8. Take action on the results.

Several types of surveys can be used:

- Personal interview
- Telephone interview
- Self-completion questionnaires (Microsoft Forms)

## 2020-06-08 Switched Keyboards

I have two mid-range nice keyboards right now. One is by RedDragon, and it is a "gaming" keyboard with red lighted keys and no 10-key pad. The other is a Gigabyte keyboard. Both have "clicky" key mechanisms. I normally used the Gigabyte keyboard with my Mac Mini. But recently I've noticed the control key (remapped Windows key) does not always work. I submitted a ticket, and the response was to test it on a Windows machine. So today I swapped my keyboards. I will use the RedDragon with my Mac Mini today and the Gigabyte with my work Windows 10 laptop. If the Windows key does not work on it, I will put in a ticket with Gigabyte support.

## Gigabyte Keyboard Customer Service

I tested the Gigabyte keyboard using my work Windows 10 laptop. The Windows key is non-functional. So I navigated to this website and submitted a ticket:

## Today's Project Managers

According to Kerzner (2017, p. 131):

> The primary skills needed to be an effective project manager in the twenty-first century are:
>
> - Knowledge of the business
> - Risk management
> - Integration skills
>
> The critical skill is risk management. however, to perform risk management effectively, a sound knowledge of the business is required.

Here _integration skills_ are roughly the ability to coordinate all aspects of the project: requirements, stakeholders, communications, resources, and constraints.

This implies a few things we should train our Project Leads:

- [ ] Business knowledge.
- [ ] Risk Management.

## Incompetent Personnel

Kerzner mentions three ways to handle incompetent personnel (on a project):

(#) On-the-spot appraisal, including identification of weaknesses, corrective action to be taken, and threat of punishment if not followed.

(#) Reassignment to less critical activities that suit their capabilities.

(#) Termination.

## 2020-06-09 Possible Co-worker COVID-19

This is a Tuesday. I received a call today from my manager, Tom Berry, informing me that a TECO employee showed symptoms of COVID-19, and a test has been initiated. The test results will not be available for 3 to 5 days, putting the results tentatively in the range of this Friday to next Tuesday. One of my direct reports, Carl, had contact with the potential carrier. He has been asked to work from home for the next fourteen (14) days or until the test comes back negative. I think I know who is being tested. HIPPA laws are preventing the company from revealing the person's name.

## 2020-06-10 Polk $\text{CO}_2$ Tank

Late yesterday, Dru Latchman texted me to see if one of my engineers or I could go to Polk today to look at an issue encountered during the installation of a new carbon dioxide tank. I assigned Carl to this, but subsequently he was asked to self-isolate for 2 weeks, so I took the assignment myself. I left the house around 7:30 am and got McDonald's on the way: an Egg McMuffin combo with a medium black coffee.

The assignment took a grand total of about 15 minutes from the time I arrived until completion. All I had to do was go out in the field with Nate Dilport and look at a steel structure. He asked if the upper brace could be removed temporarily to allow the crane boom to extend into the structure for the tank installation. It told him it was acceptable, because the lower brace would continue to stabilize the structure. The part that was disheartening was when I learned that the tank won't be delivered until September. That means my trip was not urgent. It could have waited for weeks or months. But it was a good networking opportunity with Nate, so I'm OK with it.

## 2020-06-11 OPM Expanded Staff Meeting

Jack Prestwood had his second expanded staff meeting today on WebEx because of COVID-19. David Ostrofsky gave the safety tip and a JOSH committee update. I talked about our work from home setup: Plan of the Week (POW) and daily team WebEx meetings.

## 2020-06-12 The Teacher Mandate

Today might have been a breakthrough for me at work. Tom Berry wrote me early and set forth the rough outline of a role I could play in the organization. Here is his email in its usual staccato form:

> As previously stated, shortfalls exist when it comes to in house design.
>
> We can ignore or recognize it as a challenge and opportunity to improve.
>
> In agreement with you, our approach is to improve.
>
> We need to start at the beginning and logically move forward.
>
> Our team is learning what Project Management includes, very early stages.
>
> Training is needed to grow skillsets.
>
> Suggest you, Tom and I discuss training modules and a training delivery vehicle / schedule.
>
> Suggested Modules:
>
> Project Management 101 – Expectations
>
> Engineering 101 – Expectations
>
> Cost Control 101 – Expectations
>
> Contractor Management 101 – Expectations
>
> Contract Management 101 – Expectations
>
> QA/QC 101 - Expectations
>
> We need to teach the team how to fish

I see this as a window opening to me having a direct, visible, specific, clear purpose in the organization. It will be temporary but influential. I will focus on what we want to supply to Russ and Tiller so they can provide service to the stations.

## Leadership Definition

> Influencing people by providing purpose, direction, and motivation to achieve objectives and improve the organization.

## Five Interperonsal Influences

This is adapted from Kerzner (2017, p. 152).

**Legitimate power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel perceive the project manager as being officially empowered to issue orders.

**Reward power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel perceive the project manager as capable of directly or indirectly dispensing valued organizational rewards (i.e., salary, promotion, bonus, future work assignments).

**Penalty power**: the ability to gain support because the project personnel perceive the project manager as capable of directly or indirectly dispensing penalties that they wish to avoid; usually derives from the same source as reward power, with one being a necessary condition for the other.

**Expert power**: the ability to gain support because personnel perceive the project manager as possessing special knowledge or expertise (that functional personnel consider as important).

**Referent power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel feel personally attracted to the project manager or their project.

## Project Orientation Checklist

A checklist for project kickoff or one-on-ones.

- [ ] What the objectives are for the project.
- [ ] Who will be involved and why.
- [ ] The importance of the project to the overall organization or work unit.
- [ ] Why the team member was selected and assigned to the project and what role that person will perform.
- [ ] What rewards might be forthcoming if the project is successfully completed.
- [ ] What problems and constraints are likely to be encountered.
- [ ] The rules of the road that will be followed in managing the project (e.g., regular status review meetings).
- [ ] What suggestions the team member has for achieving success.
- [ ] What the professional interests of the team member are.
- [ ] What challenge the project will present to individual members and the entire team.
- [ ] Why the team concept is so important to project management success and how it should work.

## Components of Leadership

These are from Kerzner (2017, p. 159).

- The leader
- The people being led
- The situation

## COVID-19 Scare

The COVID-19 scare at work has passed, because the person's test result was negative. Sadly, false negative rates seem to be on the order of 20% according to some Googling.

## Udemy Course on Project Management

I signed up for a course called ["Deeply Practical Project Management"](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeply-practical-project-management/learn/lecture/7368204#overview).

I am taking notes in the `teco` repository under Articles.

## 2020-06-13 Everyday I'm Shuffling

## Shuffle from the Command Line

I figured out a fun trick using the `shuf` command. You can use the `-e` (echo) option and trail the command with a list of words and `shuf` will shuffle them. Say you have to do three things today, but you don't care where to start. Let's say the things are errands, dishes, and laundry. You can do this at the command line:

```zsh
$ shuf -e errands dishes laundry
```

The command will shuffle the three arguments randomly.

```zsh
dishes
errands
laundry
```

Items with spaces in them can be included by wrapping with quotation marks (single `' '` or double `" "`) like this example from Duolingo lesson names:

```zsh
$ shuf -e Traditions Social 'Memories 2'
Traditions
Memories 2
Social
```

You can also use the `head` command to filter the results to pick _only one_ of the arguments.

```zsh
$ shuf -e eeny meeny miny moe | head -n 1
eeny
```

You can even flip a coin this way, but the [`flip` Shell Script] is more fun.

```zsh
$ shuf -e heads tails | head -n 1
heads
```

## `flip` Shell Script

Today I wrote a shell script to flip a coin. It can also pick between any two arguments that you input. For example, if you could not decide if you wanted to go to the beach or the lake you could do this:

```zsh
$ flip beach lake
beach
```

Here is the initial code which I put in my `~/bin` directory.

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh
# Written by Joe Legner 2020-06-13

# If the user inputs two arguments, those two arguments
# become the "heads" and "tails" results. Otherwise we
# default to the words heads and tails respectively.
if [[ $1 && $2 ]];then
    heads=$1
    tails=$2
else
    heads="heads"
    tails="tails"
fi

# Do the flipping and echo the result.
FLIP=$(($(($RANDOM%10))%2))
if [ $FLIP -eq 1 ];then
    echo $heads
else
    echo $tails
fi
```

## 2020-06-14 Introspection

Today I want to do some introspection.

I am forty-seven years old.

## Strengths and Limitations

I used to use the words strengths and _weaknesses_, but now after reading the army manual I changed it to strengths and _limitations_. Let's look at some.

I have a strong drive to improve myself, which I think is good. I really like developing new [habits]{#habits}. I use the [Habitica](https://habitica.com) app and website for that, mostly.

## Habits

I've been using Microsoft Visual Studio Code much more frequently recently, and I love it. I use it for a little blog and to write things for work and to develop python code and all kinds of things like that. I wonder what else I could use it for?

I think I should use the voice to text feature of my Mac more regularly. I'm a pretty fast typist, but this is even faster and more fluent! I'm doing it right now as I write this. After I write a sentence using my voice, I just go back and edit it quickly and fix any little mistakes or clarify things. Sometimes the punctuation is wacky.

## Voice Control and Dictation

[Here is a YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xalJD6V_M_4) on voice control.

OK, it turned out that Voice Control caused a severe slowdown of my computer. When I opened Activity Monitor, I found the speech detection using roughly 50% to 60% of my CPU constantly, compared with about 15% for the next highest. This made the machine infuriatingly slow. So, I disabled it. I can still use `F1` to dictate text if I feel like writing that way.

## 2020-06-15 Plumbing Repair

Today I called a plumber, because I tried unsuccessfully to repair a small leak in our potable water supply to the house. I first called Brandon Plumbing, text pictures to the guy, Tim, and he estimated almost \$700 to do the repair.

That seemed too high to me, so I called [R. J. Kielty](https://www.rjkielty.com/) at 800-330-5486. They are sending a plumber out between 2:00 and 4:00 pm today to give us a free quote to do the job. I will then pick the cheaper one.

The second guy came and said he would do it for around \$450. Much better. So I authorized him, and he replaced the section of pipe and valve. I don't think that's a fair price for the services he rendered, but it was cheaper than the competitor, and I was not comfortable working on our potable water system myself.

## Project Management Course

I am continuing the <Udemy.com> project management course. The notes I am taking are under the <https://github.com/joelegner/teco> respository.

## 2020-06-17 PECO Bucket

Our department was given a project to replace a big clamshell on a ship unloader at Big Bend Station. It's a simple job. We call something like this "in-kind replacement," meaning that the new one should be of the same exact kind as the original. The project schedule was reviewed over and over again during the winter. They were waiting for drawings. Then they reviewed the drawings. And then the bucket was on order.

Then came this week. The dock workers are called stevedores. It's a cool word that basically means people who load and unload ships. I think it's a corruption of a Spanish word. At any rate, their supervisor, Lars, told the project team that the bucket that had been delivered was 5 feet wider than the old one. Hardly "in-kind."

So I asked some questions. Where were the drawings? I was given a drawing of something from many years ago. I said, "Where are the drawings we received from the vendor that we approved before fabrication?" We didn't. We ordered a one hundred fifty thousand dollar clamshell for the only machine that we have that can unload coal from barges -- but we did not require vendor drawings and review them. If a consulting firm had done this, we would give them hell for sure, and maybe back-charged them.

It's too soon to see how my boss will react to this event. The correct answer is to implement some kind of quality control for the future. I seriously doubt he has enough wisdom to do so. Instead, I predict he will deflect and cover for his favorite employee, Dru.

It's embarrassing to be part of a department that would let this happen.

## 2020-06-18 Checking and Approval Memo

Today I submitted a memorandum to my department management. The memo is written from our director to the department. It adds requirements for peer review and approval and includes acceptable approval methods: signing or electronically signing.

## Mental Health

My mental health is suffering this week. I cannot point to the specific cause, but generally the stories my mind is telling me are about these issues:

1. Working for a boss I do not trust or respect.

1. Failing repeatedly to cause positive change in my department. We had some setbacks this week. For example, we bought an expensive 35,000 pound clamshell bucket for our ship unloader. It was supposed to be a replica of the existing one -- what we term an "in-kind replacement." But it showed up to site and our customer, the stevedores, noticed it was not. It was 5 feet wider. (I might have mentioned this in an earlier blog entry)

The worst symptom I have is that I am not sleeping well. Last night was the worst night yet. I went to bed at a reasonable hour, maybe 9:30 pm. I listened to a meditation, but kept getting lost in thought during it. I find this happens most when I have low energy. I think I did fall asleep, but I woke up at 12:30 am with a racing mind. I tried breathing exercises, but it didn't work. Eventually around 15-minutes until 2:00 am, I got up out of bed, I think for the first time in years, and went out to get a bowl of cereal. The kids were both up. Tommy told me he did not want to go to bed because he saw a cockroach. I took a slipper and went hunting for it behind his blinds. I could not find one, and I got frustrated and threw the slipper at a metal wire towel rack -- not proud of that.

I went to the kitchen. Pretty soon Tommy came out and said he saw it go into the kids' bathroom. I returned with him and retrieved my slipper. Finding the cockroach in the hallway, I snuffed out its life and flushed it down the toilet.

Then I ate my bowl of cereal on the back porch alone. The dog came out, took one look around, and went back in. It was a low moment for me.

Not long after, I crawled back in bed, lay awake for some period again, but eventually must have fallen asleep, because I woke up around 5:50 am, just before my 6:00 alarm.

My racing mind concocted the plan to send the memo I described above. I sent it to the department managers and director at 10:41 am, and as I write this it is now 12:28 pm and no response. The lack of response is understandable, because those guys are very busy, and it has not been that much time. But the uncertainty of how it will be received is weighing on my fragile mind. I hope they like it. It will be the first big win I've had along the lines of making things better.

This morning I had a two-hour conference call for a safety committee. I don't participate much in it. After the conference call, I sent the memo. I answered some emails. Then I went and sat in the yard and looked at ants, low-flying wasps pollenating tiny flowers, two white ibises, and a fight between a Northern Mockingbird and some other bird. It was quite lively, given that I was only out there for probably 30 minutes.

## 2020-06-19 Mural Stickies

Today I did a ton of work on a website called Mural.com. It's for a COVID-19 committee called the Challenge Team. I was nominated, probably by Dave Pickles, to participate in this team. It's been really rewarding to meet different people from around the company.

## COVID-19

In the past few days, Florida's COVID-19 cases have been spiking, setting new records almost daily. Yesterday was the worst yet at 3,027 new cases which was a 3.9% rise. The day before was a 3.3% rise, and before that 3.6%. Compare this to mid-May just after our brilliant governor decided by fiat that the worst was over. The week of May 18 when Phase 1 started had increases of 1.9%, 1.1%, 1.1%, 2.5%, 1.6%, 1.4%, and 1.5%. We are over double that percentage-wise, and no sign of slowing. The governor blew it. Blunder-city. People are getting sick, injured, and dying because of his hubris.

## 2020-06-20 iTerm2

Today I installed a new terminal on my Mac: iTerm2. It seems pretty cool. I based this decision on nothing at all. Here is the website that had the instructions I followed:

<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/>

Then I configured a Hotkey window and set it to `ALT+SPACE` using these instructions:

<https://www.howtogeek.com/337861/instantly-open-a-full-screen-terminal-on-your-mac-using-a-keyboard-shortcut/>

There is a lot more this thing can do. Maybe someday.

## Story Idea for Julie's Musical

Today I went for a short run of 1.5 miles, and while I was running, I was listening to a Spotify playlist of wedding songs. This is because I intend to play guitar at a wedding next December with Nate Rodriguez. But the songs were so romantic that they gave me an idea for a story. When I got back from the run, I sat out in a chair in the backyard (el patio in Spanish) and wrote this:

> Story idea for Julie’s musical
>
> Tentative title: Goodbye
>
> Opens with a couple in love. They are really good together in a way that others notice. We see them having adventure, loving life, and making the world better.
>
> We find out he is a non-believer but she believes in god. He let’s her be her. She does the same for him.
>
> On some adventures he starts getting winded. She razzes him for being out of shape.
>
> It keeps getting worse. He’s not sleeping. He’s in pain. They go to a doctor. It’s a terminal illness. He only has weeks to live.
>
> Over those weeks they hold each other. The last scene with him is them dancing slowly. He is crying. She is comforting him. She says, “I wish I could take away your pain.” He days, “My pain will be over soon. I’m crying for you.”
>
> Then he has a speech. He’s trying in a loving way to say goodbye. But it’s a goodbye that she cannot understand. It’s a forever goodbye. He knows he will be gone, completely and forever. She sees the goodbye in the context of her faith. She cannot grok it.
>
> The last word he says to her is, “goodbye.” The lights go out. Then he is gone.
>
> She holds onto his memory with all her strength. She prays and prays and cries. She is so very low. This goes on some time.
>
> Time passes.
>
> She works at a coffee shop. There is a man who comes in and orders coffee. He is obviously nervous and interested in her. He always opens with, “hello.” She is cool to him. She never says hello but just says, “can I take your order.” He is patient and kind to her. He knows her story.
>
> Now she goes through an existential crisis at her lost loves grave. She voices thoughts about god, how he never comes through. She is starting to realize she might just be talking to herself.
>
> This pattern repeats itself. She works at the coffee shop. The suitor comes in. He says, “hello,” and she does not. He is a gentleman. He drinks his coffee and leaves. When she gets off work she visits the grave. This is how we hear her inner dialog as she speaks and sings to her lost love.
>
> We watch her transform from a believer into a non-believer. She starts to notice the world more. She starts to see this is all there is: this body in this world in this moment.
>
> She starts to get better. She’s taking better care of herself. She’s coming out the other side of the grief. And for the first time she truly understands that goodbye was final. It makes her sad but also empowers her. She cuts her hair. She visits his grave and is able to really say goodbye and let him go.
>
> Now we are at the coffee shop. It’s the new her with her new hair and attitude. The suitor comes in as usual and says hello. She looks at him long and hard. She slowly crosses the room and sits down at the little cafe table. Right before the curtain drops she says one word: hello.
>
> The end.
> (Sprinkle some great songs in there)

## 2020-06-22 Couch to 5K Day One

Today is the day I did one running lesson with Joey. It went well. The first iteration consisted of six (6) sessions of 1-minute runs with 90 seconds of walking between them. There was a 5-minute warmup and a 5-minute cool-down, too. He did well and was not very winded. We ran at a modest pace on the order of 9:30 to 10:00 per mile. When we got back, I showed him a few basic stretches I learned in high school tennis.

We will run again on Wednesday after a rest day.

## Pool Party

Today Julie went over to Tiffanie's house for a few hours to hang out with her friends Tiffanie and Heather. She left the house around 12:45 pm. She said she did not intend to drink alcohol and would be back to help Joey sign up for classes.

## Document Management Application

I once again decided to try finding software that I could use to organize my large collection of PDFs. Here's what I found.

- **Calibre** - Seems clunky and dated looking.

- **Mendeley** - I saw Elsevier's logo on the bottom-lefthand corner of the screen and walked away. Elsevier's business model is antithetical to my worldview.

- **Polar Bookshelf** - This one looked so promising, and it had the University of Illinois logo on the front page. The problem is they have this paid cloud service, but the service's upper limit of 12GB is insufficient for me. I have something like 78GB of PDFs. Plus it would cost me around \$15 per month even for 12GB of storage. And they don't let you use Google Drive or Dropbox instead. I thought about using it locally, but when I opened the first few documents (`.epub` files) I got an error message. Not a good experience, so I shitcanned.

- **Zotero** - I've tried this one before.

## 2020-06-23 Magic Keyboard

I am typing this on an Apple Magic Keyboard. It's pretty cool so far.

They layout would be something that would take some time to understand. And the feel is much different. But it's almost "clicky". Hard to express with these 26 characters.

## Met with USF

Met with Yogi, Venkat, and Tom Berry about a process USF wants to pilot at one of our stations. The pilot plant would take $\text{CO}_2$ and $\text{H}_2$ and produce methanol. The methanol can be used to store energy. Or it can be immediately burned in a combustion turbine.

## Archie and David Ostrofsky

David Ostrofsky put in a hazardous condition report about a contractor on top of a trailer without a harness and without a pre-job briefing. Today our COO Archie Collins wrote to David to ask who was responsible for the contractor. David is now worried that there will be blowback against our co-worker Dave Davis.

I told David to write to Tom Berry and Dave Davis' boss Russ Human before replying to Archie. I also texted Tom Berry these messages:

> Archie wrote to David about that near miss and asked who was responsible for that contractor. I told David to write to you and Russ before replying. I don’t for a minute think Archie is the kind of guy who is going to be punitive. But I wanted you to have the heads up.

> If you advise to do something else please reply or reach out to David by email, text, or phone. I coached David that he did the right thing speaking up. He does not want blowback for Dave Davis or anyone else. He was trying to improve safety.

## Joey Driving Lesson

I took Joey out on the road today. This is part of my 4-point plan to help him. I started by showing him how to check the oil. Then we drove for 58 minutes around the area, mostly on rural roads. He did a good job overall. We practiced a 3-point turn about 3 times during the drive. He needs 50 hours to be prepared for his license, including at least 10 hours at night. So today he achieved 2.5%. I sent him this text message:

Tommy came and asked me when I would show him the computer guitar effects. We tried for a few minutes to find Tonebridge for Windows, but it is only for Mac. So we instead installed Native Instruments Guitar Rig 5. We also had to install the drivers for the new Focusrite Scarlett that I just bought from Amazon.com.

## 2020-06-24 Running with Joey Day 2

It was so hot today when we ran. It was 97 degrees. This session was 8 runs of 1-minute each. Joey got pretty tired after the first 6, so I recommended we slow the pace for the last 2 runs. I said to just keep running, no matter how slow. The speed does not matter. What matters is that you do not give up. He came through.

He said after last time his calves were a little sore. This time he was also complaining about his upper back. He's so skinny. But he did it!

## 2020-06-25 A/C Condenser Went Out

Last night I did not sleep well. And today I'm grumpy because of it. To make things worse, when I got up the temperature in the house was 79 degrees when it should have been 75 degrees.

The inside unit was running (all night), but the condenser was not running when I looked in the morning. It tries to start but cannot. I did some Googling and decided it is a capacitor.

Today the high temperature is supposed to be 97 degrees.

When Julie woke up I gave her the bad news. She wanted to help. I was pretty grumpy which did not help the conversation. We tossed around the idea of trying to repair it ourselves, but I was having a hard time finding the part nearby. It's not at Lowes or Home Depot. I suggested we call the same A/C repairman we used last time. She was like, "Really?!" because she figured his poor service was what led to this. I lost my cool and stormed out of the house to cool off, but only got as far as next door and turned around. We had a brief hug and moved on.

Right now I am sitting with the fan full-blast on me as I type this. She did call the guy, but he has not called back.

## Carl Williams California Trip

Carl called me to let me know he might have to return to California next Thursday, July 2. His adult stepson lives out there, and a month or two ago he got into a terrible accident and got severely injured. Carl went out by plane with his wife and stayed for one week. She has been there ever since. Her son has been in the hospital the whole time, apparently, and now they are contemplating moving him to some other facility. She wants Carl to come for help and support. He's strangely distant about the whole thing. I don't know what their relationship was like, but he seems noticeably unconcerned about the kid. All he kept talking about was how much he disliked the idea of being on an airplane during this pandemic.

## Joey got a B in English

Joey completed his online English class and earned a B. We are happy about that! Just a few years ago he was getting D's and F's in _physical_ school, but he has been really getting better at _virtual_ school now.

I hope this gives him a little confidence. I'm so sorry for him. He is awkward and scrawny and weak. And smart and depressed. He's a lot like me. I was only 145 pounds when I graduated high school at 5'-9" tall. He is already taller than me. But it's like he is cursed. I want to lift his curse, and I am trying four new things right now: (1) running with him, (2) setting him up with a keyboard and Mac to do music, (3) driving practice, and (4) playing video games together. OK, the last one we have not done yet, but I want to do it this weekend.

## TECO System is Under Stress

Today the TECO power system is under stress. The load is expected to be over 4,500 megawatts (MW) at the peak, which is approaching a summer peak record. At the same time, not all our units are available, and the other power companies in the state cannot sell us power, because of their own peak loads. If one big unit trips, we may have to shut off customers.

On top of that, our Supervisors of Plant Operations (SPOs) are in short supply because of exposure to COVID-19. There are only so many people who are qualified to run one of the power plants. If we lose a few more, we will not have enough to run the system.

And on top of that there is apparently a cloud of dust from Africa heading toward Florida. It might affect our units if it gets into the filters.

## Duolingo Update

Today in Duolingo I got to Level 1 in **House 3** and **Health** in Spanish.

## Driving Session 2

I took Joey out again driving today. He did well! I tested him at checking the oil, and he did it correctly the first time. I only showed him once before, so he's a quick study.

We drove to Lowes first, and he practiced parking a little. Still need to practice to get good enough. We then drove straight north and just wandered about the semi-rural streets and roads of Seffner, Florida. His speed was better, but he still slows down to much when he is turning. Sometimes he almost comes to a stop when turning left without any oncoming traffic. I will work with him on that. Today's theme was "rhythm and spacing." There is a rhythm to traffic, and I like to keep some space around me at all times. It's a good margin of error.

## Open Pit and Rice-a-Roni

Tonight we made our famous Open Pit and Rice-a-Roni dish. Right when I was ready to put the chicken on the grill, a huge thunderstorm struck our neighborhood. It was pretty violent with lots of lightning. I had to wait it out quite a long time, and when I finally was able to put the chicken on, still in the rain, it did not brown up as much as I would like, because the lid had been on to protect the fire from the rain. But, hell, it was not that bad.

## 2020-06-26 BB4 Natural Gas Upgrade Fiasco

Today I started reviewing a scope of work for the Big Bend 4 Natural Gas Upgrade project. It's an EPC scope for a major upgrade of the burners that pump natural gas into the boiler. I barely got into the scope when I realized this document is woefully inadequate. It is not ready to be put on the street. It does not seem biddable to me at first reading.

I raised this issue with Tim Parsons. I trust Tim. He skimmed the document and he and I confirmed that none of his GTS engineers had been part of its preparation. He is a by-the-book guy, so rather than raising an alarm, he suggested I work up my hierarchy and recommend to Tom Berry that GTS should review the document. That's what I did. I copied my Gmail account with the correspondence so I have a record of it free and clear of TEC.

Tom Berry is incompetent. He worked with Jeffrey Martin on the scope, apparently without input from anyone else except an operations engineer, Gary Grotegloss.

Tom seems to have ignored the recommendation to get GTS involved, unless he is doing it behind the scenes without telling me. I asked him if he was going to use the document as an RFP for the project, and he said yes, that he was.

I don't know what else to do. It's a helpless feeling seeing my department produce garbage and not having any authority to act to help make it better. The best I can do is let it play out naturally and see what happens. I told Tom my review was only cursory, and that there was not enough time to do it justice before next week.

## 2020-06-27 Grand Theft Auto V

Today I played Grand Theft Auto V (five) with the boys. It's something I've been wanting to do. I set up my Windows laptop out in the living room, got through the intro level and then got pretty far on about 3 or 4 tries on level 1. It's the level where two guys are stealing a white and red car and have to get them somewhere quickly. I keep trying with the red car, but my driving skills leave much to be desired. It's the speed that's killing me. Also, I am not used to operating the standard `w`, `s`, `a`, `d` buttons for moving around forward (or up), back (or down), left, and right, respectively. I will keep practicing. I think the kids enjoyed it.

## Axis and Allies

We also set up Axis and Allies on the kitchen table. But alas, we could not find the little plastic poker chips. Julie found some online and ordered them, so we will proceed once we have those.

## 2020-06-28 Axis and Allies Setup

The boys and I selected our countries and set up our pieces for the game. We reviewed some of the rules, through Chapter 3. Unfortunately, the original little plastic poker chips are missing. Julie found some on Amazon and ordered them, and they should be here Monday or Tuesday. Today is Sunday.

## Music Documentary

Tommy, Julie, and I watched a documentary where Jakob Dylan, Bob Dylan's son, went around and interviewed people who were active in an area called Laurel Canyon in 1960s Los Angeles. The title is [Echo in the Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_in_the_Canyon). It was very good to see Tom Petty alive and well. RIP T.P.

## 2020-06-29 Bayside Visit for Gannon Admin Demo

Today I had to go to Bayside to walk down a potential project with Josh McMann. The station wants to demolish the old 3-story Gannon admin building which is at the east end of the plant.

## Record Albums

Tiffanie brought over a big box of vinyl record albums that Ken did not want anymore. Last Christmas the kids each got a record player, and they like to listen to vinyl, so this was a boon to their collection. The stuff seems to date back to the 1970s and is a mixed bag of decent albums, sketchy crap, and German sing-alongs. Ken's mother came over from Germany.

## Graph Theory PDFs

I found some graph theory PDFs and started making some Anki cards from them. I've always been interested in graph theory. It relates to some things I like such as CAD drawings and network diagrams including Gantt charts and even mind maps. I'd like to know the basics.

## 2020-06-30 Text Editor Try-Outs

I'm a little tired of the bad performance of VS Code right now. It's lagging badly. The Git integration has been sketchy. And it seems to consume lots of resources. I like the plug-ins but with so many installed, I cannot easily tell which one is making it lag, if any. So I decided to try out a few other candidates.

## Sublime Text

This one is not free, but I downloaded a trial. It costs 80 dollars.

## Atom

This one was apparently developed by Git's former owners and now is owned by Microsoft. This makes me a little nervous that it will take second place to VS Code. It's free, however, which is good.

## Notepad++

This one only runs on Windows, so I did not do anything more with it.

## Joey Drove to Wawa

Today was our twice-weekly driving excursion, and I had Joey take a round-about path to the Wawa on West Brandon Boulevard over near Portillo's. He did great and parked perfectly. He seems to be gaining confidence which is wonderful to see. We got snacks for everyone and took them home.

## Mac Mini 2020 Arrived

My Mac Mini arrived today in the mid-afternoon. I hooked it up and set it up to transfer from my old Mac Mini using the built-in migration feature. It took a long time, maybe 6 hours. First it had to do an update, and then it transferred a half-million files or so between the two. It was still doing the transfer when I went to bed.

## 2020-07-01 Mac Mini 2020 Day 1

Today is the first day I am able to use my new Mac Mini which I am calling "Mac Mini 2020" to differentiate it from the older one: Mac Mini 2014. So far it is amazing. It is so much more snappy than the 2014 model. I'm thrilled so far. Even VS Code seems to be operating on all cylinders. I was considering switching to Atom or something else, but I think it might be OK to keep using VS Code with this new machine.

## Stop the Spread Training

I took "Stop the Spread" training on eKnoweldgeCenter. Here are the key points I recorded:

- No work is so important that it cannot be done safely.
- Objectives
  - [ ] Be responsible
  - [ ] Be measured
  - [ ] Be flexible

The training described the basic janitorial services before the outbreak.

After that, Facilities Services raised the janitorial requirements. They added day porters, cleaning of touch points like elevator controls, hand sanitizer at key locations, and additional nightly disinfecting using CDC approved chemicals. Additional cleaning and inspections of HVAC systems were added. Sewage lift stations were inspected - the virus is known to be present in fecal matter.

- A system will be established for team members to drop off borrowed equipment for cleaning and re-inspection.
- Shared drink dispensers are shut off.
- Bottled water still provided.
- Coffee still provided, but coffee makers may be relocated.
- Furniture will be relocated and signage added to maintain social distancing.
- Fitness centers will remain closed.
- Maximum bathroom capacity will be established and posted.
- Conference rooms will have maximum capacity limits. Until posted, they should not be used.
- Signage will be posted around the building, especially in high-use areas.
- A safety kit will be provided before returning to work and will include hand sanitizer and wipes.
- Team members will be required to self-monitor their health and answer a questionnaire provided by the company.
- Team members will be required to take their temperature before coming to work each day. If they have an elevated temperature, they will be required to stay home.
- Do not return to building except for a valid business purpose.
- Only employees and essential 3rd parties will be allowed access to our buildings.
- Face coverings required if you cannot maintain 6 feet distance.
  - Cloth face coverings must fit snugly. Discard after getting wet or contaminated.
  - N95 and KN95 masks can be used up to 5 days, stored in a breathable container like a paper bag. The company will provide 5 such masks. They will be replaced after 5 weeks.
  - Surgical masks not allowed.
- Overnight use of refrigerators not allowed.
- No catered meals. Delivered food is acceptable, but team member must meet the delivery driver at the door in the lobby.
- No occupying cubicles adjacent to an occupied cubicle. Occupying adjacent offices is acceptable.

## Running with Joey -- Day 5

Today we did lesson 5 of the Couch to 5K program. There were four runs at 90 seconds each with 2 minutes of rest in between followed by two runs at 60 seconds each with 90 seconds of rest in between. We sprinted the last 5 seconds of the final 60-second run. It was only 93 degrees out, so it was easy. Joey said his soreness is pretty much gone from his calves already.

## Fajitas

Julie bought some top sirloin and marinated it today. I started the Weber grill right when we left for our run. When I got back, I grilled the steak while she sautéed the vegetables. The fajitas were a hit. I grilled one ear of sweet corn to go with mine; nobody else wanted corn, so I have two leftover ears for tomorrow or this weekend.

## Bleach in HVAC Drain

Today I poured about 1/4 gallon of bleach down the HVAC drain, but diluted with water to make it 1/2 gallon.

## 2020-07-02 Eisenhower Matrix Thoughts

Today I am concentrating on how to best utilize the Eisenhower Matrix for my personal productivity. I will limit to work-related thoughts. Non-work projects, chores, relationships, etc. may be dealt with some other day.

![Eisenhower Matrix](images/eisenhower-matrix.png){ width=50% }

## Daily Scheduled Tasks

I'm starting to think about the four buckets of the Eisenhower Matrix:

1. Do it now - for tasks that are both _important_ and _urgent_.

2. Schedule it for later - for tasks the are _important_ but not urgent.

3. Delegate it - for tasks that are not important but still _urgent_.

4. Eliminate it - for tasks that re either important nor urgent.

### Urgent

What is urgent? Here are some takes on it from the Internet:

> Urgent activities demand immediate attention, and are usually associated with achieving someone else's goals. They are often the ones we concentrate on and they demand attention because the consequences of not dealing with them are immediate.

This one makes an interesting point about urgent things being about _someone else's goals_. I guess what they mean is that my own goals will be properly planned, so they won't ever become urgent; that is, demanding immediate attention.

### Important

The word "important" needs to be expanded to "important to me." I cannot do every single thing. The intent of my new focus on the Eisenhower Matrix is to decide which tasks I should spend time doing.

It seems to me something is important if doing adds value:

- Moves a project forward
- Improves the organization
- Mitigates a risk
- Benefits a stakeholder (including me)

### Quadrant 1 - Do it Now ("Do")

What goes in this bucket? Here are some ideas.

1. An acute crisis, dispute, emergency. A chronic crisis or dispute goes in Quadrant 2.

1. A looming deadline that won't get done on time unless I work on it now.

1. Something requested of me last minute by someone in authority over me, but only if it is important. Otherwise, I should first ask them, "Is this important enough to delay the work I planned to do today?"

### Quadrant 2 - Schedule It ("Decide")

What goes in this quadrant?

1. Pre-planned project-related tasks.

1. Controlling activities for projects such as schedule reviews.

1. Providing purpose, direction, and motivation to team members.

1. Performance reviews, lessons learned, and soliciting feedback from superiors, customers, peers, and other stakeholders.

1. Project, team, and safety meetings.

1. Studying something I am committed to learning, such as Spanish (Duolingo) or Project Management (Udemy course).

1. Self-care including breaks, lunch, and exercise.

### Quadrant 3 - Delegate It ("Delegate")

Delegate stuff for which I have a comparative advantage. This means, if the opportunity cost of me doing it is higher than the opportunity cost of the delegatee, it makes sense to delegate. For example, I might be good at taking meeting minutes, but if it keeps me from doing engineering, it makes more sense to give it to an admin person.

1. Routing messages and instructions for the team.

1. Preparing agendas, submitting meeting minutes, saving to SharePoint site.

### Quadrant 4 - Eliminate It ("Delete")

Tasks that are triaged into this quadrant are time-wasters. They do not contribute to our goals. That's not to say they are entirely useless, because entertainment is important for mental health. But we are using this matrix for _productivity_.

What goes in this bucket? Here are some things that I would put here for me personally.

1. Mindless browsing of the Internet.

1. Learning trivia on WikiPedia.

## Tentative Eisenhower Matrix Workflow

### Receive New Request

1. Triage:

   A. Is it important? Does it advance a professional or personal project, objective, or goal?

   B. Is it urgent? Does it demand attention right now, or can it be scheduled?

### Start of Each Week

### Start of Each Day

## Habitica Habits

I have been using Habitica for some time, and here are my top three "dailies".

![Top Three Habitica Dailies on July 2, 2020](images/habitica-habits-2020-07-02.png)

## 2020-07-03 Company Holiday

Today is the company's Independence Day holiday. It's on July 3rd because the 4th of July falls on a Saturday this year.

## Playing Around with Atom

I watched this video and changed a few settings in Atom to play around with it.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPC6keUUiTA>

I'm writing this journal entry in Atom.

`Atom > Preferences > Editor`

- [x] Scroll Past End
- [x] Soft Wrap
- [x] Soft Wrap at Preferred Line Length (which I set to 80)
- [x] Show Indent Guide

`Atom > Preferences > Packages > tree-view`

- [x] Hide Ignored Names
- [x] Hide VCS Ignored Files

![Atom Keyboard Shortcuts](images/atom-cheat-sheet.png){ width=100% }

## My Aspirations

What do I aspire to become? I do not want to stay static and just get along in life. I want to constantly improvement myself. The top of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is called _self-actualization_. It's something like achieving your full potential. I reckon if I build on my strengths, that will maximize my potential. What are my strengths, then?

**Strengths**

- Integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness
- Learning
- Cognition, analytic thinking, meta-cognition
- Problem-solving, decision-making
- Well-organized
- Communication
- Computer Skills
- Time Management
- Problem Solving
- Effective Listener
- Well Organized
- Bi-Lingual
- Musical talent

**Limitations**

- Fear, anxiety
- Self-control
- Impatient
- Does not take criticism well

My strengths lend themselves to a broad range of pursuits. It could be music. Right now I don't feel like music is the right area for my attention. We are not going to be able to play out anytime soon. And playing out is a lot of work for not that much reward, at least for me. I could do some writing or recording, I guess.

One thing that comes to mind is this: be ready to die.

I love learning. I love writing things like this journal. I love using computers, especially to get them to do something useful.

What do I love? I love a job well done. I love succeeding in obtaining objectives.

## My Statement of Purpose

My purpose is to be a self-aware, rational, caring, and wise leader of others.

## 2020-07-04 Independence Day

Today is Independence Day which is the day that the Declaration of Independence was published. It is truly the founding document of our country. The Constitution is something that we can change, but the DNA of the country was set forth in the Declaration.

## Daily Pattern Proposal

I am going to work on the taxes today. This should be my pattern for each day. I will write it in some basic pseudocode modeled after Python.

- Do morning routine:
  - Put in contacts
  - Brush teeth
  - Treat ears with Scalpicin
- If it is a work day:
  1. Process emails
  1. Collect urgent, important tasks (UI Tasks)
  1. Do the UI Tasks
  1. Review **Work Plan** [Microsoft Planner](https://tasks.office.com)
  1. Prioritize non-urgent, important (NI) Tasks for the Day:
     - Consider due dates, energy level, resources at hand
  1. Do each NI Task (bulk of day should be this)
  - At lunchtime study Spanish, Duolingo, Anki and current course, book, paper
  - At end of day, process emails
  - Collect UI Tasks for the next workday
- Else (non-work day):
  1. Collect urgent, important tasks (UI Task)
     - Family problems
     - Upcoming deadlines (tax filing)
     - Problems around the house
  1. Do the UI Tasks
  1. Review **Personal Plan** on [Microsoft Planner](https://tasks.office.com)
  1. Prioritize non-urgent, important (NI) Tasks for the Day:
     - Consider due dates, energy level, resources at hand
     - Consider how neglected the project has been
  1. Do each NI Task (spend an hour or so)
  - Sometime through the day do _Dailies_:
    - Study Spanish, Duolingo, Anki and current course, book, paper
    - Work on something for the kids
    - Process Gmail In Box
  - As desired:
    - Relax
    - Play
    - Read and explore new subjects
- Do bedtime routine:
  - Take out contacts
  - Floss
  - Brush teeth

: It _must_ get done.
: Doing it will move a project forward.

Not Important
: I can delegate it.
: It _should_ get done.
: No key objective hinges on it getting done.

## Open a Random File

This command will open a random file in the current directory:

```bash
open "$(find . -type f | shuf | head -n 1 | xargs)"
```

You can modify it to open, say, PDF files only.

```bash
open "$(find . -type f -iname '*.pdf' | shuf | head -n 1 | xargs)"
```

## Fireworks

Toward the late afternoon I dug down into the plastic storage bench we keep on the porch and took out a huge Ziplock bag containing fireworks leftover from last year. They included snap caps, about four Roman Candles, and gobs of bottle rockets. I turned one of the charcoal chimney lighters on its side, and we leaned bottle rockets against it and set them off. The entire neighborhood was alight with fireworks, and an eerie haze of smoke gave the world an unnatural aura.

## 2020-07-05 Resetting the Mac Mini 2014

Today I erased the hard drive on the Mac Mini 2014 and reinstalled the macOS as a prelude to giving the machine to the kids to record music. I followed these instructions:

First I [started macOS in Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314).

Then I [erased the disk](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496#erasedisk) and renamed the hard drive:

Hard Drive Name: `Apple HDD Legend Family`

After that I [reinstalled macOS from macOS Recovery](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904).

## 2020-07-06 Day Off

I took today off to make it a four-day weekend. I woke up at my usual time just before my 6:00 am alarm, but I did not get out of bed immediately. I probably got up around 7:00 am.

I shuffled my studies for the day using this command:

```zsh
shuf -e Udemy Anki Duolingo
Anki
Duolingo
Udemy
```

I did not have any broken Duolingo lessons, so I just shuffled the two lessons twice each:

```zsh
shuf -e House3 Health House3 Health
Health
House3
Health
House3
```

## Juran on Quality

Joseph Juran is a famous thinker about quality.

> Sense 1: "Quality" means those features of products which meet customer needs and thereby provide customer satisfaction. In this sense, the meaning of quality is oriented to income. The purpose of such higher quality is to provide greater customer satisfaction and, one hopes, to increase income. However, providing more and/or better quality features usually requires an investment and hence usually involves increases in costs. Higher quality in this sense usually "costs more."

But he gives a sense 2 of the word:

> Sense 2: "Quality" means freedom from deficiencies—freedom from errors that require doing work over again (rework) or that result in field failures, customer dissatisfaction, customer claims, and so on. In this sense, the meaning of quality is oriented to costs, and higher quality usually "costs less."

![Juran's Two Senses of Quality](images/juran-quality-defs.png)

## Requirements

Defining requirements is essential, but it must be done with care. We run the risk of (1) omitting requirements that are necessary to achieve the objective and (2) including requirements that go beyond what is necessary. Requirements that go beyond what is necessary for the agreed upon outcome should be the objectives of other projects.

We cannot remember every requirement. We must write them down, and then refer back to them at every step along the way. We can write them any of several places:

1. General to the organization
   1. Standards, including TEC Design Criteria
   1. Policies, processes, job aids, etc.
1. Specific to the project.
   1. Project Charter
   1. Project Plan

## Email to Band Director

We are supposed to send Tommy to drumline practice tomorrow at the high school. But we are not happy about it, because we are worried about COVID-19. It's a predicament. Either we send our kid and risk it, or he gets left behind on the drum squad. I drafted this email to Mr. Sever, but we have not sent it yet.

> Dear Mr. Sever,

> My wife and I are concerned that holding drumline practice now is too risky in light of recent trends in infections. It feels like you are expecting parents to subject their child to a small but real risk of a debilitating or even fatal disease in order to participate in band at a time when Florida is a hot spot for new infections.

> We carefully track the COVID-19 cases and deaths. The cases have spiked dramatically since the governor relaxed restrictions. It seems likely the deaths will increase in proportion, albeit delayed a few weeks.

> While the young generally seem less strongly affected by the disease, it's not always that way. There have been adolescents die from it in Florida in recent weeks.

> And the long-term effects are not yet understood. There seems to be some risk of permanent loss of taste. We would not want our son to lose his sense of taste at age 14 for the rest of his life. And worse can happen and does.

> I hope you will reconsider this decision and stop the practice, but at the very least, you should reassure parents who are (we think wisely) reluctant to send their children that there will be no retaliation for keeping their child safe at home.

> We are happy to discuss with you at your convenience by phone, text, or email.

She did not use my email and instead called him and asked him to call back. He did call back later in the evening. He seemed sympathetic, but used a couple phrases that gave us pause. He said something along the lines, "if this turns out to be as dangerous as they are saying" or something which led us both to decide he might not be as serious as us.

## 2020-07-07 Drove to the Mall

It was Joey's driving day, so we drove to Brandon Mall in a roundabout way. We drove down Valrico Road, turned left on Lithia-Pinecrest, turned right on Bloomingdale, and drove all the way to 301. There we turned right and immediately turned right again onto the I-75 ramp. This took us to the frontage road. We turned right onto Route 60, then turned right into the mall. We parked near the food court and walked to 711 to get drinks for the kids. He did well. No big mistakes, just inexperience showing a few times.

## Quality Assurance and Quality Control

Quality for a structural drawing means something like produces a structure that meets code and customer requirements as economically as possible.

## 2020-07-08 Blood Work

I woke up a little early around 4:45 am, took a shower, and drove down to Baycare arriving right at 6:00 am. Alas, they did not open until 7:00 am. I stayed in the car and listened to about 3/4 of a podcast by Tara Brach about meditation. She was talking about how to deal with feelings of guilt. She kept bringing up white guilt and what she termed "white fragility," whatever that means. But her story about not blaming oneself for their shortcomings was pretty moving. She talked about a guy who had a terrible temper, and he realized it came from his father. He was able to forgive himself for it and get better.

Julie wrote me while I was gone and was worried where I was going "every morning." I told her yesterday I went for a walk and today I went to get blood work done - she knew about the 2nd one already. She was sleeping when I went walking. I fear for her if anything ever happens to me.

## Week 3, Run 2

Today we ran again. Julie brought Maggie on a leash, and we all walked together halfway around the block to the south. Remember, our address is 819 Walsingham Way, Valrico, Florida. But when the 5-minute warmup walk ended, Joey and I took off.

He did well again. The weather was only 88 degrees today which also helped. But I think he is getting in better shape each time. He said his side does not really hurt now. I told him it would be gone in another week, and that is a sure sign that he is getting in shape.

## Best Practices in Quality Control and Assurance in Design

Here are some reading notes from _Best Practices in Quality Control and Assurance in Design_, NCHRP Project 20-68A, Scan 09-01.

The next several sections present the successful solutions that the scan team identified:

- Training and Communication Channels
- Review and Approval Processes Checklists, Manuals, and Standards Scoping and Environmental Quality Consultant Selection and Communication Construction
- Reviews and Feedback
- Quality in Existing Processes

Definitions:

Quality Assurance
: Actions to prevent defects or make improvements in the policies, procedures, and systematic actions established to ensure quality

Quality Control
: Actions to catch defects; the independent checking of work and use of control points (approvals) to ensure a high level of confidence that each product will meet expectations

## Partnering

What if we called our feedback loop system "partnering" as in we are partnering with the stations to benefit us both?

## Quality Improvement

Possible lessons learned process:

1. Read each lesson learned to a group of key stakeholders.
1. Describe what negative result occurred in as much detail as possible.
1. Ask the group, "Why did it happen?"
1. For each response, ask again "why?" until the root cause becomes clear.
1. Ask the group, "Can we start, stop, or change something we are doing to avoid this problem?"

## 2020-07-10 Joey Cleaned Patio

Joey came to me this morning asking me about whether we would still be getting a weight bench. I said, "Yes, but I don't know where to put it." We settled on putting it out on the porch by the kitchen window. I asked Joey to start moving things out of the way for it, including our three kayaks. He did so until it started raining.

## Red Lobster

We ordered a bunch of food from Red Lobster tonight. Is the first time since the COVID-19 epidemic that we have ordered from them. It was really good! We MBfgot a couple different fried shrimps, shrimp scampi, for baked potatoes, a fried fish, and green beans for something like 65 bucks plus tip.

Julie and I had an "appetizer" before we got the food, and I think I found out my tolerance is through the roof. It did not work very well for me.

## Body Scan

<https://palousemindfulness.com/MBSR/week1.html>

## Joey Running

Unfortunately we did not run tonight. Joey fell asleep at some ridiculously late hour, like 2 pm, so I did not want to wake him. I did knock twice around 6 pm, but he did not stir, so I left him alone.

## Dictation

I'm trying to use dictation more and more. The shortcut key is F1.

## A->B Thinking

One aspect of intelligence is that it seems to be connected with word associations. It goes something like this.

1. I have a sensation of some kind: sight, sound, smell, taste, thought, or bodily sensation.

1. The sensation triggers the recall of an object from memory: another word, concept, idea, image, feeling. This is the `A->B` part.

1. Object recalled then triggers yet another word, concept, idea, image, feeling.

1. This continues until either:

   A. The idea is one of action, and you go do the action.

   B. You get distracted and snap out of the chain of thoughts.

   C. You become mindful of the runaway thoughts and snap out of it.

   D. You fall asleep.

Knowing all this, I wonder if I could not hack my brain by mindfully choosing which `A->B` connections are strengthened. I could do this strategically to get better, happier, more content, more loving, more generous, more caring, etc. I could make myself better this way.

I guess I am doing this right now, come to think of it. For example, a minute ago I was browsing a website looking for a Caltrans quality manual to read. But it dawned on me: I have been trying to "Stop collecting and start reading." The chain of events went like this:

1. I realized I was "collecting."

1. My Anki training kicked in and I thought of the mantra: "Stop collecting and start reading." This was my _trained_ response.

1. Then I realized that this was one of my `A->B` connections. This was an _untrained_ response. And in this case, it was an insight, not just a long useless chain of thoughts.

Maybe _intelligence_ when you are good at quickly making `A->B` connections but _wisdom_ is when you are good at making `A->B` connections that are helpful.

This sort of goes with the ideas of David Hume that I recently read. He says that ideas are either (1) matters of fact, or (2) relationships between ideas.

`Human Mind = {Impressions, Ideas}`

`Ideas = {Matters of Fact, Relations Between Ideas}`

`Relations of Ideas = {Resemblance, Contiguity in Time or Place, Cause and Effect}`

## 2020-07-11 Porch Cleaning

When I got up today around 7:00 am, Joey was still up from last night. He sleeps on a schedule opposite to most people. But when I said, "Hey, let's go do our run," he said, "OK, sure. Now?" So we did. Today's runs consisted of two minutes, then two runs of three minutes each, and one last two-minute run. He got through them. I think it pushed him a little more than it did me, but I've been running a _little_ all along.

After we got back and refreshed ourselves, we went out to continue working on the porch. The objective is to have a little home gym there. So we swept the floor, shifted some things around, and then brought the furniture back in. I also cleaned the stainless steel table, and I tried to destroy some fire ant nests.

Next thing we need to do is shop for some waterproof gym mats, a bench, and a set of weights. We might try to find them at Dick's Sporting Goods. That would be probably cheaper than trying to ship them, because they are so heavy.

## Taxes

Today is the day we have to finish our taxes. The taxes are due in four days, and I am about half done with them. I need some more input from Julie to complete them. I will send her an email.

Here are some breadcrumbs for 2020 taxes.

- I found Form 1098 for mortgage interest on Grow Financial's website. I logged into the regular account, clicked on the mortgage, went to a summary page, clicked an **e-Docs** link, clicked **My Docs** and then scrolled down to find **Tax Document** which was it.

- Form 5498-SA does not need to be entered. It is for information only.

- Form 1095-C does not need to be entered. It is for information only.

## FICO Score

We have a really good credit score right now.

## Home Gym Project Day 1

[Home Gym Project Plan](./gym.html)

`Key objective -> requirements -> solution definition -> WBS`

Let's do a project using the techniques taught in the Deeply practical project management course on you to Udemy.com. I will explain how we went about doing this on the journal. And the project plan will be given in the knowledge base pages section.

The project is a home gym that we want to put on our back porch. During the coronavirus pandemic, I have not been able to go to the gym. Joey also wants to start working out. So we decided we would install a simple home gym to allow us to do StrongLifts 5x5.

The first step is to create and agree upon an objective statement. This is a one-sentence statement of the desired final outcome.

## 2020-07-12 Cleaning for One Hour

Today I cleaned the house for 1 hour. I decided to make it even more specific for next week: "Clean something other than the kitchen." I also considered being even more specific, such as: "Clean glass or floors not in the kitchen."

Maybe what I should do is scout around the house and determine what needs to be cleaned regularly, then decide which things are cleaned _least_ often and make those my top priority. The other stuff is probably OK without my special attention each Sunday.

## Anki Discovery

I discovered Anki decks can be put into a hierarchy, and when you study the top deck, you study all of them. So I put all the decks under Default and then renamed it to General.

![Anki Reorganized into Hierarchy](images/anki-hierarch.png)

It took me 20 minutes to study 141 cards today.

## Home Improvement Shopping

I shopped for a weight bench, barbell rack, a barbell, weights, and flooring today for our project on the porch. Weights are hard to come by right now! I guess because of coronavirus every place has sold out of a lot of things. Right now I have about 1,200 dollars in the Amazon cart but have not placed the order.

I did order a desk for the Mac music workstation project from Overstock.com. I had to chat with a guy to change my email from joseph.legner@verizon.net to joelegner@gmail.com. Apparently I signed up in 2003, ordered something then, and have never been back!

## Website Project Idea: Habit Builder

### Objective

To create a website available from anywhere that I can use to track and develop good habits self-actualize.

### Minimum Usefulness Requirements

1. You can view habits and add, delete, and edit them.
1. Habits have maturity levels that affect how often you are reminded.
1. You are periodically reminded to make sure you are doing your habits.
1. The system is automatically backed up on a recurring basis.
1. Enough documentation to maintain and improve it.

### Minimum Viable Product Requirements

1. Registration
1. Account management
1. Hosting (less than 10 dollars per month with SSH)
1. [habits.lovebirdapps.com](https://habits.lovebirdapps.com)

### Visualization

### Solution Thoughts

Each account has a set of habits. Each habit has a maturity level:

1. **New** - Nag
1. **Developing** - Remind.
1. **Strong** - Check in only occasionally to check for lapses. Offer to increment. Lapses go back to Developing.

Desired habit frequency can be: (where $n\geq1$)

1. Every $n$ days
1. Every $n$ weeks
1. Every $n$ months

Appearance should be similar to <pinboard.in>: very sparse and spartan. Maybe I can just "plagarize" his front-end setup. The backend and the guts are the fun part, anyway.

The architecture will be a simple **front end** and **back end** setup.

### Set of Possible Features

1. Annual payment system
1. Dark mode and light mode
1. Documentation
1. favicon
1. Gradual increase in habit responsibilities.
1. Graphs of progress
1. Leaderboard
1. Logo
1. Mobile application
1. Mobile website
1. Multi-tenant
1. MySQL database
1. Never miss twice (like Don't Break the Chain, but you get one mulligan)
1. Points system
1. Product name
1. Styling
1. Tagging system
1. Terms and conditions
1. Zen styling with calm photos

### Next Actions

- [_] Prepare a WBS of all the tangible deliverables.

## Deep Project Thinking

A good work breakdown structure is important. If it is done correctly, it identifies all the work needed to deliver the objective, and no more. This makes it incredibly easy to know what we should be working on now and what we will have to do later.

Productivity means making progress toward the completion of any item included in the work breakdown structure. The work breakdown structure in its totality _is_ the project. Delivering these things is how the project _achieves_ the objective.

The objective is always the state of the world we want at the end. An end deliverable, then, is something that needs to exist at the time the objective is achieved. An interim deliverable is something that needs to exist between now and the end date of the project.

We can imagine the day that the objective is met. We must visualize what is in the world that was not before: new equipment, platforms, steel, foundations, piling, electrical cables, and even OEM manuals, training materials, and properly recorded lessons learned. These are the _end deliverables_ to the customer: the one who requested and is paying for obtaining the objective.

The end of a project is defined as the date the last required end deliverable is turned over. With all deliverables delivered, by definition, the objective has been met.

## Joe's Evolutionary Development Methodology (JEDM)

1. Decide the next baby step needed to move the project forward.

2. Work to accomplish the baby step.

3. Record a breadcrumb explaining what you did to achieve the baby step.

4. Take a step back and think about the big picture objective.

5. Return to 1 above.

## 2020-07-13 Gypsum Walk-Down

Today I drove to Big Bend and attended a walk-down with David Ostrofsky to discuss the design we need to deliver in a few weeks. We ran into Tom Berry out south of the waste handling building. He was looking at a fire line that had ruptured below ground. The station had dug it up with a backhoe to repair it, and he was contemplating how to capitalize it.

## Paul Carpinone

Paul Carpinone is the director of environmental downtown at the Plaza. For some reason over the weekend he invited me to a conference call -- just him and me. He was in the dark as to why his department does not get invited to projects anymore. I told him our procedures had changed. We do not do formal PSA documents any longer (not my choice).

## Joey Running

Joey and I ran today. It was a little harder for him this time, it seems. The first run was 3 minutes, and after a two-minute walk we ran for four minutes. The path we took was down some cul-de-sacs in the neighborhood. We talked a little about philosophy. I didn't know he was interested in that. I told him my favorite was David Hume followed by Aristotle.

Joey also surmised that he would be out on his own soon, like within 1-2 years. I told him no way. He was surprised. I wonder if I gave him the impression that I expected him to leave. (?) Anyway, I assured him that I expected he would live with us at least into his early twenties. He keeps bringing up not wanting to be a burden. I don't know what brought this about, but I tried to reassure him that he is not a burden. For example, he wants to put on some muscle, and I told him he will have to eat more. He said he has been saving protein shakes until we get a home weight set. He said it was to save money. I told him not to worry about that and drink the shakes. Not sure where his head is there, but I will straighten him out.

## Groceries

Today was the first day that Julie used curbside pickup to get groceries. The cases in Florida are skyrocketing. She is getting pretty nervous, and she's amped up lately because Republican politicians are pushing _hard_ to re-open schools in the fall - the fall being in about 4 to 6 weeks, apparently. They do not seem to have noticed that we are setting new records almost daily here in Florida. Yesterday was something like 15,000 and today 12,000. The deaths have not followed the same precipitous growth pattern -- I don't know what to make of that. My mother accused me of listening to Fox News. She does not know me at all. I told her I do not watch _any_ televised news, because it's all garbage.

## 2020-07-14 Drove on the Interstate

Joey and I did our driving practice again today. We went north and caught I-4 in Seffner, and we drove east to Plant City. We exited there and went back on a county road to Brandon. He did great. We talked a little about philosophers while we were driving, but I did most of the talking. That's OK because one of the habits I am trying to cultivate is to initiate the conversations with him and, as I put it on my Anki card, "Show him how it's done." haha.

## Julie Not Feeling Well

Julie was not feeling well today. She slept well, but in the middle of the day she hit a wall and could not stop yawning. When I came out from a conference call, she was asleep on Tommy's bed. That's unheard of. I let her sleep while I took Joey driving. When I got back, she was up and about, but still not herself. I don't know what's going on, but it's obviously concerning with this pandemic spiraling out of control all around us. She does not seem to have the other symptoms, so I think she's OK, but time will tell. If she does end up having it, we can point to today (July 14) or yesterday (July 13) as the start of the symptoms, albeit mild ones so far. May they stay mild.

## Worked on Habits Website

I worked on the habits website today and added a feature: it now records the yes and no responses and reports them. It's very simple right now, but it does something and keeps the data which is cool.

[Github respository](https://github.com/joelegner/habits)

## Sargent & Lundy

I asked Sargent & Lundy to provide an SME to be interviewed by a safety committee. At first they agreed, but then today Jim Kamba hit me up for a PO. This is for 1-2 hours. Harkening back to my days as a consultant, I would not _dream_ of asking for a PO for a few hours of someones time. We used to go to Crystal River and answer questions left and right. I get it that they don't want to work for free, but this kind of thing seems to me to be a business development expense. Hell, they used to pay for expensive parties for all of my department and their spouses! I told the committee chair, canceled the S&L engineer's attendance, and asked Stantec to attend instead. I'm not playing that game, and I will remember this.

They will learn who the customer is. Fuck them.

## 2020-07-15 Challenge Team Presentation

Today is the culmination of about eight weeks of work on the inaugural TECO Challenge Team. The challenge team was initiated by Emera to give an opportunity for some up-and-coming leaders to tackle one particular issue and make recommendations to the executive team. A team of 11 of us worked on the problem under the tutor of one of our vice president, Renee Gallant. We also had help from IT and an outside consultant from a company called Doblin named Sco (short for Francisco).

The challenge was to present to leader ship what kinds of changes we would make to the company knowing what we now know after COVID-19. It is supposed to be forward-looking. The leader ship is already continually assessing the status in real time during the pandemic. What they need is to visualize what the end result is.

Part of the last presentation is for me to give an "elevator speech" about my own experience on the team. I want to mention how much my family and I have benefitted form working from home. But I also want to point out that the Challenge Team assignment is essentially a simulation of the role of an executive team.

## Elevator Speech

I thought about using my elevator speech to talk about how the challenge team is like an executive team in a sandbox. But Rene said to speak from the heart, so here goes.

I love working from home for a slew of reasons, but I want to focus on one: My relationship with my two boys is flourishing because I am working from home. We are closer than ever before, and at the most critical time: their teenage years.

My younger son is 15 years old. He will only be living with us for maybe 5 to 7 more years. And I'm cherishing every day we have to together. He picked up the guitar his father before him, but he has a passion for it I never had. He has already surpassed me. Because I'm not at the plant, when I walk to get a cup of coffee, he is there. I can stop by and see what he is doing. He watches Youtube videos by guitar players and about guitar playing. We can talk about them - about what he is learning. We can talk about musical scales, styles, and techniques. I can see when he's frustrated or tired or angry or happy. While he is in the house, I do not want to go back. The roots of my heart are firmly planted here.

My older son just turned 17. He is a gamer and an artist. He is an emotional and deep thinker. He met a girl, and he is trying to better himself. He has been very sedentary his entire life, and although he is thin, he is not fit or strong. He's working to improve those things.

Because I am not exhausted from two hours in traffic every day, I have the energy to run with him in the evenings. We are about halfway through an eight week program to go from the couch to a 5K. He has stepped up and dedicated himself to it. He never resists when I remind him it's our running day. I'm proud of him.

Because of working from home, we ordered a weight bench and weights. Because I work from home, we will be able to work out together. I can teach him and learn from him.

Because I have 10 more hours a week not spent commuting, I am able to take him out driving two days a week to practice for his license. While I am driving I am coaching him, and we are learning about each other. I found out he is interested in philosophy like I am. I had no idea.

Working from home, my life has been enriched. At least as long as my boys are here, which is probably another 10 years, I do not want to go back to the old way.

> Postscript: I did not go with this speech.

I did not go with it. Here's why: the other people from the team that went before me played it straight and just did the usual, "Here's what I learned from this challenge..." thing. I did not want to grandstand and do my prepared speech. It would have seemed weird.

So instead, paraphrasing, I said this:

1. This experience was like executive leadership in a sandbox. We had a challenge and an objective. We didn't have enough time or information. But we had to make a decision. Yet it was like a sandbox, because we could not screw up anything.

2. The experience left me feeling like the company is in good hands. Not only do we have existing leadership that is conscientious about running the company and cares about its employees. We also have up and coming people like the challenge team that show the future is bright.

They seemed to really like it. Archie Collins, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) called me out by name a few times and messaged me privately. No telling if he messaged others, but I will take it either way. He specifically recalled the sandbox part and said something to the effect, "I'm sure many of you someday will be making real decisions that actually matter outside Joe's sandbox." What a gratifying experience the whole thing was.

I intend to ask Rene Gallant for some personal feedback before we move on. I'm also supposed to present the findings to my performance coach (Tom Berry) and director (Jack Prestwood). I need to schedule that tomorrow.

## Drove to the Hard Rock Casino

Today was supposed to be running day for Joe and me. Unfortunately, there was a big thunderstorm all over the area at the time we were supposed to run. So I asked him if we could switch driving tomorrow for running today, and he said OK.

We drove down 60 all the way to 301, turn right, and headed up north to I four. We got on I four for a short distance, and then exited to the Seminole Hard Rock casino. I took him around to the back of the casino, and we drove to the top of one of the parking garages. It was good practice for him. He also drove in very heavy rain the entire time. At one point, we hydroplaned a little bit. I think it was a good experience for him in his practice.

## Pizza

Julie had put a chicken dish on the menu, but the two chicken breast she got out from the freezer never really thought during the day. She was a little frustrated, so I said, do you want to do something else? She agreed. We talk to the kids and of course they wanted pizza. We ordered it from babes pizza. They now deliver.

## 2020-07-16 Dismantlement Presentation

The main highlight today at work was a dismantlement presentation that I gave to Jack Prestwood, Tom Berry, Russ Human, Tiller Mills, and Tom DeYoung. Well, Tom DeYoung was sort of a co-presenter.

I presented maybe about 17 to 20 slides. It was very well received. They have asked me to now rework the slides and present them to big Bend station later this month, probably around the end of July.

## Changed Outlook Default Color

I reorganized my Outlook colors and categories to accord with my system of urgent / non-urgent, important / non-important based upon the following ground rules.

Most schedule activities are non-urgent. But they can be either important or not important. So we get three possible combinations on the calendar:

- Not urgent + Unimportant = colored GREEN on the calendar. This is my new Outlook default color. Most of my meetings fall into this category.

- Not urgent + Important = colored YELLOW on the calendar. Use sparingly for things I must attend to personally, things I am leading, etc.

- Urgent + Important = colored RED on the calendar. Use this rarely. Most urgent things should be done immediately. Only schedule something if it is going to take a long time to complete it.

## School Board Meeting

Julie attended an on line school board meeting today for Hillsboro county. She said many many people were opposed to returning to school. As of right now, Hillsboro county schools intent to return students to the brick and mortar schools starting this fall. Like many other parents, we are strongly opposed to this idea.

Tommy, Julie, and I sat around the kitchen and talked about all the issues. Tommy is a little disappointed that he will not be returning to a brick and mortar school, but not terribly so. We told him that he will be doing e-learning, which is led by an instructor rather than the online self paced study that he does not do well with.

I made a prediction today: there is no way that Hillsborough Schools will open this fall. I base this on very little. I just think cooler heads will prevail and realize what a stupid idea this is.

## Run with Joey

Joey and I could not run yesterday due to a torrential downpour. So he agreed to switch driving and running. Yesterday we drove to the hard rock casino as mentioned. Today we did the next run in the eight week program. The runs today were 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 5 minutes, and 3 minutes. We talked a lot along the way which I think took Joey's mind off the difficulty. We also ran fairly slowly. He did well.

Maggie gets upset when we go running and do not take her on a walk. She paces the floor and goes under Julie's desk. Then she gives us the cold shoulder when we get back. She did it again today. But after dinner, Julie and Tommy took her on a walk.

## Zsh `$PROJECTS` Environment Variable

I added an environment variable called `$PROJECTS` to my `.zshenv` file. I can use it in paths. It points to my Google Drive projects folder.

```zsh
$ cd $PROJECTS
/Users/joelegner/Google Drive/Projects
```

## Zsh `p` Alias

I also added an alias `p` that changed the current directory to the path defined by the `$PROJECTS` environment variable.

## Axis and Allies

Joey, Tommy, and I continued our axis and Allies game today. It was a lot of fun. Tommy was just talk Talk Talk. Joey got distracted a few times with his phone, but that's OK. He has a girl now. I am playing United States, Russia, and Great Britain. Joey has a pretty good game plan in the far east. He placed a factory on the mainland, and now he has six armor they're ready to attack.

I was able to capture Western Europe with the British forces. I also captured French Indochina Burma, but Joey took it back later the same turn. When I got to the United States, I put a factory in China. I also reinforced Western Europe with a lot of planes, and to American infantry from Africa.

## Julie's Computer

Julie is having computer problems. She get so mad, slamming her fist on the desk and yelling. She is easily frustrated and lets everyone around know it. I made the mistake of walking up and trying to help her, but she brushed me off saying she did what I was about to do (check the Task Manager to see what was bogging down the machine). Then she was offended when I walked away to go to bed. I told her it was because she said she already did everything I wanted and finally made it safely back to our bedroom. She's on the warpath, and I am avoiding her and going to sleep. Good luck!

## 2020-07-17 Two Rounds of Axis and Allies

Joey, Tommy, and I played two rounds of Axis and Allies today. It was so great. It felt like the best times of my childhood were happening. I remember sitting around the dining room table with Rich back when I was maybe 11 or 12 and playing that game. Rich would whip me, because he was seven years older and wiser. He had at least some kind of strategy in mind even at age 18 or 19.

I have been saying all along that this is a practice round. I've been giving them both advice. Already I can see great improvement in their gameplay! The first round Tommy made some interesting decisions like buying bombers instead of armor. Later I destroyed his three bombers with an attack. That was 45 IPCs worth of production that could have been 9 armors.

## My Definition of a Game

"A game is an activity that is governed by rules and does not have important consequences without your consent."

## 2020-07-18

Today is Saturday. I got up around 7:00 am and assembled the weight bench we ordered that was delivered yesterday afternoon. Then I took out the trash after I noticed it did not get done yesterday.

As I am writing this, everyone else in the family is asleep. I hope they are having pleasant dreams.

## Sqlite GUI

I would love to have a nice SQLite interface that is more like Excel. The nice thing about Excel is that it is snappy and easy to enter information. This is in stark contrast to the SQLite command line interface (CLI). I searched for `sqlite` on the Mac App Store and here is what I found.

- **Valentina Studio**: 3.8 out of 5, 12 ratings. The ratings are from up to 6 years ago. Last release was 3 weeks ago. The pro version costs **200 dollars**.

- **SQLite Flow**: 4.1 out of 5, 12 ratings. The last rating was from May 29, and it was a good one. Seems to be a Chinese company which I do not like given their recent track record spying on people. The pro version costs **12 dollars**. But it's much cheaper than the SQLPRo line. (Update: Tried on 7/18 and hated it.)

- **Native SQLite Manager**: 4.8 out of 5, only 4 ratings. Light and dark mode available. Seems to have one developer named Krystian Kolodziej. Last updated 5 days ago. Seems to be **free**.

- **Liya**: 5.0 out of 5, only 7 ratings. It looks like I tried this one before. Looks like a one-man company. Appears to be **free**.

- **SQLPro for SQLite**: 4.5 out of 5 with 84 ratings. This is by far the highest number of ratings right now. It is listed as #36 in Developer Tools. The website looks professional and modern. It has a copyright mark dating back to 2012 by Hankinsoft Development, Inc. Seems to do light and dark mode. There are separate apps for the different databases as well as a SQLPro _Studio_ which seems to have all the popular ones. SQLPro for SQLite only is **40 dollars**. SQLPro Premium - Lifetime is **220 dollars**. One of their other products, SQLPro for MSSQL is listed as #18 free app under Developer Tools. The SQLPRO SQLite version is #21. (Update: tried and I did not like it. I thought it would have a tabular editor, but I could not use it because of feature limitations which is too bad.)

- **Splice**: 4.4 out of 5, 16 ratings. #57 Developer Tools. Pretty professional [website](https://glimpse.io/splice/). Seems to support most databases. The word "sqlite" only appears on two pages, and I don't see a screenshot with the word sqlite in it, but it seems to support it. It might even support MS Access .mdb files. Splice Unlimited costs **40 dollars** after 2 weeks. Last update was 1 year ago which is a head-scratcher. (Update: tried and no thanks. I could not open or create a sqlite database.)

- **DB Browser**: Not on the App Store. Gave me this error: "DB Browser for SQLite.app can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software." Then I tried the previous version, and it worked. I've used it before. It seems tolerable, so I will keep it.

- **SQLite Studio**: Developer could not be verified, so Mac would not let me open it. This is probably a worthy safeguard, so I am not going to disable it to try this program.

I decided to try SQLiteFlow. No way. It's not a spreadsheet-like interface. To add a row requires me to click a `+` button every time. I uninstalled immediately.

Next I tried Splice, since it's only 40 dollars. Also nope.

Okay, okay, I will try SQLPro Studio. It's expensive, but let's see if it is worth it the way Excel is worth it. Aaaaaand it was not worth it. Forget it.

## DB Browser

I ended up installing a program called [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org). It is free and open source and is close enough to what I wanted. I'm content.

## Fidelity Re-balancing

Today I re-balanced my Fidelity rollover to 80/20 split between stocks and bonds by the following steps.

1. Logged into Fidelity account.
1. Researched and found `FUAMX` bond fund which has an extremely low expense ratio of 0.03.
1. Looked on the Analysis tab to see how much I had. The split was 90/10.
1. Calculated how much stock I needed to sell to purchase bonds to get back to 80/20. It was 12,000 dollars.
1. Sold 2,400 dollars of `FNCMX` to buy `FUAMX`.
1. Sold 4,800 dollars of `FSKAX` to buy `FUAMX`.
1. Sold 4,800 dollars of `FXAIX` to buy `FUAMX`.

The whole event including writing this journal entry took about 10 minutes.

## Refrigerator Not Working

Back in May we had the refrigerator repaired. Today Julie realize that the temperature was really high. She measured 60° inside the fridge. The freezer is working just fine, which means it is the fan that blows the cold air into the fridge that's the problem. Since the repair technician cannot come until Monday, we moved critical items into the old beverage fridge. That old fridge is a trooper and never fails us.

## Hot Dogs for Lunch

We had a hotdog feast for lunch. I grilled them on the gas grill. We heated up a can of steak 'n Shake chili that we had in the cupboard. Then we had out diced onions, a bunch of different kinds of mustard, cheese, pickled jalapeños, and ketchup.

## Set up Music Workstation

I put together the new desk and set up the Mac Mini 2014 today. It's awesome! Tommy messed around with his guitar and different amp sounds. He was having a great time. Everything seems to work, except I have not yet hooked up the Korg keyboard to do midi.

![Tommy at the Music Workstation](images/Tommy-workstation.jpg)

## Run with Joey

Since we got rained out the other day and switched with driving, we decided to skip Friday for rest and run on Saturday.

## 2020-07-19 Sunday Funday

Today is Sunday. I am trying to build a habit to clean for 1 hour on anything other than the kitchen each Sunday morning. It's nice, because usually Julie sleeps in, so I work while she is in bed. Today I washed off the circular table on the patio, the outside cover of the hot tub, and the gas grill.

I also made a pass through the living room area and took away all the little items that were not necessary to be there ("sort" in 5S terms). This included a lot of papers, batteries, some audio cables, USB cables, a phone charger, a kitchen knife, my laptop power supply, a small camera tripod, guitar picks, a lighter, and a cellphone mounting clip.

## Mover Los Muebles

Hoy movimos los muebles en la sala.

We are trying to get the room to work better with the new music workstation. Joey took the recliner into his room. We swapped the couch and loveseat, putting the shorter item next to the music workstation to reduce the amount of encroachment. Julie scraped the top of the end table, and I took it out back and spray painted it over the course of a couple hours, letting each thin coat dry in between.

## 2020-07-20 Fridge Repair

The main fridge was not keeping things cool on Saturday, so Julie called the last place that repaired it. The previous problem was a fan or flap that admits cold air from the freezer into the refrigerator compartment. Since the freezer is still frozen, we assume this is a reoccurrence of that problem.

## Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

My recent blood work reported a possible AKI - acute kidney injury. I thought it might be a glitch in the test, so I sent a message on the Baycare website to my general practitioner, Dr. Michael Burnette. He had his assistant call me today and tell me that he is not concerned about this. He thinks my kidneys are working fine. I have no evidence to contradict this except the one report, so I bet it is right. I'm not going to worry about it.

## Apple Support Community

I created user name `JoeLegendSr` for Apple Support Communities.

## Running Tonight

Joey and I did a run today. The first run was five minutes, followed by a six minute run, and ending with another five minute run. I think Joey was pretty tired at the last minute of each run. But he did it just the same. He has the tendency to look forward to the next run and worry about it. I am trying to influence him by suggesting that all he needs to worry about is the current run. I even went so far as to point out that all we need to do is get to that next intersection or something. Maybe he will grok it later.

He was very talkative today, which I loved. It seems like our level of communication has greatly grown since we started this little adventure. Today he was talking a lot about politicians, COVID-19, in the state of the world. I suggested that he could maybe drive comfort from the fact that the world has always been this shitty. But here we are anyway. There are always going to be shitty ass politicians in charge, but the bulk of the world is solid and seems to survive these jackasses being in charge.

## 2020-07-21 Drove to Ybor City

Joey got some very good driving practice today. We left the house at 4:30 and got back home at 5:35. We drove west down Lumsden to Falkenburg, then north to the crosstown expressway. We accidentally exited onto I-4 and headed west. We drove down by Stetson and then into Ybor city. We had to wait for a train two times; it was the same train each time. We returned on Route 60 all the way from Ybor in some moderately heavy traffic. He did well. Maggie went with us.

## Refrigerator Repair

The refrigerator has the same problem as last time: the motor that actuates the flap to let cold air from the freezer into the refrigerator compartment is malfunctioning. The repairman had to order a new part. He used a wooden chopstick to prop open the flap temporarily while the part is ordered.

This morning I measured 38 degrees Fahrenheit in the refrigerator compartment which is just fine to me.

In related news, my coffee was about 170 degrees from the Keurig after having sat while I brushed my teeth. It might have been higher when it first came out of the machine.

## Mindfulness at Waking

Today I woke at about 4:00 am and sort of dozed until I got up at 6:00. During that time while I was laying in bed, my normal pattern of intense thinking started. Today I used mental noting and redirected my attention to bodily sensations: breathing and the pressure and weight of my body on the bed. It was nice. I might like to try it again and even make it a habit. I wonder if it was facilitated by getting decent rest last night.

## Mindfulness of Thoughts

I seem to detect three broad kinds of thoughts:

- Planning
- Remembering
- Fantasizing

The first kind includes thinking about what I need to do today, what could go wrong, what I might gain by a decision, etc. The second kind includes hearing songs in my head, thinking about past events or people, recalling information that I need now or in the future, etc. The third kind is the most interesting. It often involves thoughts about an alternate universe where some aspect of my life is different than it is now.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be someone else, especially when I think about events like the Holocaust. This I guess falls into the fantasizing category, but also into the remembering category.

## Duolingo Acing a Skill

Today I got an interesting message while doing Info. 2 lesson. I took them up on it.

![Duolingo Acing this Skill Message](images/duolingo-acing-skill.png)

## 2020-07-22 Feedback from Renee Gallant

Renee Gallant is a Vice President, and he was the Challenge Team sponsor. After the team's work ended, I emailed to ask him if he would mind giving me some individual feedback. He accepted.

Today we met on WebEx, and he gave me some good feedback. Here are some of the highlights:

- I had a good balance between trying to lead the team and following when the time was appropriate.
- The Venn diagram I made has been well-received.
- I was one of three he thought really shined. The others were John Heisey and Trinh Le.
- I have personal charm, even on webcam. This one was nice to hear! I did joke around a lot and tried to keep it pretty light.
- Be patient with people when I'm trying to drive change. Some people need "soak time" to get to the step I am at. I see this with Tom Berry and others.
- Build a coalition to make change. Tom DeYoung is already part of my coalition. The person I really need to add is Russ Human. After Berry is gone, Russ will have the greatest influence with Jack Prestwood (the director).

## Tommy Geometry

Tommy got 100 on his two final exams in Geometry! He finished the class with a solid B grade (~83 I think). This is amazing considering how fully he loathed geometry early on. We had some serious familial clashes over it. Eventually I intervened and helped him. I taught him the famous `SOHCAHTOA` which got him through a bunch of lessons and problems on the final. When we got to the part where he had to complete the square (something I never quite understood), Julie helped him instead, and he was successful with that too.

## Running

Joey and I ran again today. He was dreading it, because the runs of 5 minutes, 8 minutes, and 5 minutes seemed daunting. But we ended up talking a lot about Star Wars which took his mind off things. We did not make a good pace (about 10-minute miles). But dammit, we finished despite his complaints. I think he's maturing a lot.

## Refrigerator Now Fixed

The repair man came over with the part today and installed it. The refrigerator seems to be working again.

## Useless Math Problem about Probability

I have a strange idea to solve a useless math problem: how many rolls of snake eyes is closest to a one-in-a-million chance?

The probability of rolling snake eyes is $1/36 \approx 0.0278$. The probability of rolling $k$ snake eyes is then:

$$Pr(x=k) = (1/36)^k$$

Setting this equal to 1/1000000 give us:

$$(1/36)^{k} = (1/1000000)$$

Recognizing that if we solve $b^k = x$ for $k$ we get $k = \log_b x$ we can solve for $k$:

$$k = \log_{(1/36)} (1/1000000)$$

$$k = 3.855291627 \text{ (rolls of snake eyes in a row)}$$

This is a surprising result for me: less than 4 rolls!? Let's check our work with a calculator.

When I enter `(1/36)^(3.855291627) = 0.000000999999999` which is an error of -0.000000000661495. It's correct!

Since we cannot roll the dice 0.855 times, we need to round up or down. The error of the two values 3 and 4 are 20.433 and -0.405 respectively therefore the answer we get is:

$$\boxed{k = 4 \text{ rolls of snake eyes}}$$

The probability is about 1 in 1,680,000 to roll 4 snake eyes in a row. Surprising to me.

Now let's see how many _individual dice_ you would have to roll 1s on, $k$, to get a 1 in 1,000,000 chance, shall we? The probability of a success is $5/6 \approx 0.833$.

$$k = \log_{1/6}{(1/1000000)} = 7.7105833$$

Testing this result with a calculator, I get `(1/6)^(7.7105833) = 0.000000999999917` which is an error of -0.000000083082427. It's correct!

Rolling 7 dice gives you a probability of 0.000003572245085 or about 1/279935. Rolling 8 dice gives you a probability of 0.000000595374181 or about 1/1679616 (1 in 1.68 million).

$$\boxed{\text{Rolling 1s on 8 dice}}$$

The probability seems to be the same: 1 in 1,680,000. But is this a surprise? No. 

In the first experiment, there is only one event _E_ in the sample space _S_ that corresponds to success: 4 rolls of snakeyes which is 8 6's. In the second experiement, there is only one event in the sample space that corresponds to success: also 8 rolls of 6.

To get to a perfect 1 in 1,000,000 chance, we need a sample space with exactly 1,000,000 possible experiement outcomes with only one of them being considered a success. Dice are not good for this, because 6 is not a divisor of 1,000,000. But I want it to be something handy around the house. Sure I could use my phone, but what's the fun in that. It should be a physical object doing the randomizing.

We are off to a good start already because:

$$2^{20} = 1048576$$

The error of this value is only 4.86 percent. So we have a fun answer:

> Getting heads on a fair coin 20 times in a row is approximately equal to 1 microprobability.

How can we use this to imagine what small probabilities are? Let's talk micromorts. A micromort is a 1 in a million chance of death. Living in an industrial country for 1 day at age 20 is about a micromort. Skydiving is about 10 micromorts. 

Suppose we take the 1 in a million chance. We will arbitrarily take heads to be good and tails to be bad. If we flip tails 20 times in a row, we die. If we roll heads even _one_ time along the way to 20, we live. That's pretty much the same chance as 1 micromort.

[Driving is 2 micromorts per hour](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/sites/default/files/images/staff/Bruce/Micromorts_0.png). The risk of death for me at age 47 per day is about 6 micromorts according to [this website](https://charlesfudgemuffin.blogspot.com/2017/01/micromorts-risk-of-dying.html) (for Julie it's 4 micromorts per day). So if I drive for 3 hours, that alone would double my chance of dying that day. Interesting.

Suppose we want to simulate what 1 micromort is like. We can play this game.

Flip a coin until either (1) you flip a single heads or (2) you flip 20 times. If you flip a heads, you live. If you flip 20 tails in a row, however, you die. This experiment should go rather quickly, because you should flip a heads on or before the fifth flip about 97 percent of the time. At 5 seconds per flip, that is 25 seconds for the experiment. Getting to 20 flips is daunting. But this is what a 1 in 1,000,000 chance really feels like.

Here's another fun one. According to [this website](https://www.thrillist.com/cars/nation/how-likely-you-are-to-die-in-a-car-accident-in-every-us-state-the-most-dangerous-roads-in-america), the chance of dying in a car crash in Florida is 1 in 8,123 per year. Using our coin-flipping, this is equivalent to flipping thirteen tails in a row, because $2^{13} = 8192 \approx 8123$.

## Called Grandma Davis

We called Grandma Davis tonight, ostensibly to tell her about Tommy's recent grade. But I just wanted to be kind, too. She seemed happy that we did. Joey was in his room and did not participate. Julie, Tommy, and I talked to her on Tommy's speakerphone on the back porch. She recently said the thought I was watching Fox News (?) but I think today she realized she had misjudged me.

## Thai Food

We decided to make tonight our "support local" night, where we order food from a local place to support the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since Tommy did so well on his geometry, we rewarded him by letting him choose the place. After much debate, he settled on a Thai place called Lemon Grass. Julie ordered through Uber Eats.

The food was delicious! We got some curry dumplings, crab rangoon, chicken sate, a chicken and shrimp stir-fry, and other stuff. Tommy got a dessert that was interesting. It was sweet, sticky rice with fresh mango. He also got some kind of Thai tea thing.

## 2020-07-24 Run with Joey

Today is Friday, happily. It was a pretty good week. Joey and I did our last run. It was two 8-minute runs. I kept talking to him to keep his mind off the hard work he was doing. I figured if he could keep talking, he was okay. We made slow time, I reckon, but who gives a damn. We did it and celebrated.

## 2020-07-25 Hiking Trip

Today we went walking along the trails at [Hillsborough River State Park](https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/hillsborough-river-state-park).

## 2020-07-26 Cleaned the Toilets

I did the "shine" step of 5S today on the two toilets. They were both pretty gross. I took me nearly an hour to complete the job. I never really got all the buildup off the bowl in the kids room despite really bearing down first with a sponge and then with a brush. It looks way better, but it is not completely gone. I used CLR (Calcium-Lime-Rust) cleaner.

## 2020-07-27 Squirrel Exclusion

Yesterday we realized that there is a squirrel making a nest under the ridge cap above the garage. Today I got on the roof with a screw gun and closed the opening. Hopefully this will keep the squirrel out.

## Message Flowchart

## 5S on my OneDrive

I spent about an hour re-organizing my OneDrive using 5S steps. Right now I have a list of folders under Filing that are organized by category of deliverable. There are still a number of files that need to be _sorted_ (5S step 1) -- kept or discarded -- and then _set in order_ (5S step 2) by arranging them into the deliverables-category folders.

## Big Storms

We could not do our runs tonight because of thunderstorms. The storms started around 5 pm or so and continued until after dark at 8:30 pm.

## 2020-07-28 Running in the Rain

Joey and I did our next run in a lull between thunderstorms. There were two 10-minute runs with a 5-minute walk in between. He did well. It was much cooler, but the air was thick with humidity. I kept him talking to distract him and make sure he was not over-exerted. The rule-of-thumb I follow is that you are working too hard if you cannot carry on a normal conversation.

## "Nobody" Died

Julie has been on a team for a game online, and she has gotten to know people long-distance. One had the moniker "Nobody" online, and the team was "Nobody's Team."

He caught coronavirus and informed the team. They were all worried, so Julie and a couple others tried to track him down using his email username. They found him. The guy was a former detective, now retired and living in Miami with his 2nd or 3rd wife.

He had a bad case of COVID-19, and early this morning she heard from his wife that he passed away. She was pretty shook. She's been awfully worried about COVID-19 with mixed emotions about how it has been negatively affecting her music career. She wants constant reassurance that it's a real threat and she's acting rightly. I hope this event seals that for her.

## Dust-Up with Scott McCoy

Scott McCoy chimed in on Julie's Facebook thread and made some snide comment. For the first time I can remember, I actually wrote to him privately something to the effect, "Hey, man, not cool. If you value your relationship with Julie, I would delete this. Take care." He did take it down, but then he accused Julie of deleting him as a friend. I think that was actually a mix-up, because he has two profiles or something, and Julie said she did not _friend_ the second profile to begin with. But I don't care about Facebook anymore, so who cares about that.

## 2020-07-29 Trip to Manatee Viewing Center

I had to visit the Manatee Viewing Center to see a construction project that Tampa Bay Marine is doing. I met Stan Kroh there, and we walked around and looked at the work, and I took some pictures.

Joey drove me there and back. This was a great driving challenge for him which had a lot of important skills. I had him use GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) navigation to make sure he could follow its instructions. He only messed up one time when he failed to get into the left turn lane when instructed. I coached him what to do. Other than that, he drove perfectly well. He changed lanes a little more abruptly than necessary when he first got on the Interstate, and I coached him to be slower with that movement. I asked him if he felt like he was "getting the hang of this driving thing," and he said he was which made me happy. I think the practice is helping his confidence which is exactly the objective I was trying to achieve. We still have a long way to go.

## 2020-07-30 Essay Idea

Julie was making grandiose statements about me last night like I am the next evolution of the man that Thomas Jefferson plus David Hume combined represent. It was sweet but too over the top for me. But it did get me thinking. What if I could offer something to the world in written form that would influence people in a way that made the world a little better?

This morning I started thinking about some ideas. What would my theme be? What would the point of my first essay be?

- Freedom of expression is the most important thing we need to protect.
- Communication is the set of methods by which one mind may affect another.
- We only have two mutually exclusive ways of communicating: persuasion or coercion. The second one should only be used as a last resort.
- Cancel Culture is coercion. Rioting is coercion. Riot police tactics are coercion. Online shaming is coercion. Intimidation is coercion.
- Persuasion or rhetoric takes mental effort. This is the one noble achievement of humanity: we are able to lead others by talking.

Where would I post such a thing? I guess I could mail it to newspapers, the New Yorker, or write a blog. I have never published anything.

Would I publish under my own name? Would I instead publish anonymously like the Federalist Papers? Maybe I should read some of the Federalist Papers to get some inspiration.

If I wrote pseudonymously, what name would I use? Would I allude to David Hume?

## AHP Example

I'm trying to use the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to make a decision. The decision is about what software side project to undertake. Here is my first draft of the AHP diagram:

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example01.png)

Next I used the [AHP-OS AHP calculator](https://bpmsg.com/ahp/ahp-calc.php?n=4&t=AHP+priorities&c[0]=Reasonable+Size&c[1]=Fun&c[2]=Time+Saver&c[3]=Career+Benefit) to assign priorities to the criteria.

![Prioritized AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example02.png)

## Theft of Squat Rack

Since I cannot work out at the office anymore, I ordered a bunch of weight equipment from Amazon. Today I went on my phone to see the status of those deliveries, because many of them were delayed. Lots of people are making home Jens during coronavirus pandemic. Lo and behold, one of the packages was supposed to have been delivered on Saturday, July 25. Sadly, we did not receive it. We think it was stolen.

If you recall, that was the day that Julie and I went to Hillsboro River Park and went hiking. The kids, as usual, we're sleeping in until the late afternoon, and did not hear the delivery. There was also evidence in the neighborhood that someone had tampered with mailboxes.

I reported the theft to the seller. I also reported it to Amazon, but they said the delivery was the responsibility of the seller in this case. As of right now I have a little hope that this will be resolved in our favor. But perhaps, since we paid with a visa, it will be.

## Running

We finally got a chance to run today with decent weather. It was sunny and about 90°. The runs were both 10 minutes each, with three minutes of walking in between. It was the same as the last day, except the room walk was shorter. Last time it was five minutes. Joey seem to get pretty tired at the end of this one. But he persevered, and we did it. I think it was the temperature and son that got to him this time.

Saturday we are supposed to do our third round of this week. Unfortunately, tropical storm Isaiah is in the Caribbean and will likely affect our area on Saturday or Sunday. We may not get a window between rain bands.

During the run, he said that his girlfriend, Paris, is getting a cockatiel bird. He seemed concerned that the bird lives a long time. Please note that she is 14 years old right now. Wikipedia says that they live 16 to 25 years. That's quite a long time. But I think it's a little premature to assume that they are going to end up together forever.

## 2020-07-31 Half-Day PTO

Late yesterday Julie asked me to take Paid Time Off (PTO) today -- known elsewhere as "vacation." However, I have to attend a WebEx with the President of TECO, Nancy Tower, as a follow-up to our Challenge Team. So I did the next best thing and took 4 hours of PTO.

## GTK

GTK is the Gnome graphics toolkit. It's apparently possible to use it on a Mac with Python by installing something called PyGObject. I tried today, and I kept getting installation errors. The documentation was lousy. I gave up after about 15 minutes of trying.

If I do a GUI someday, I will probably make it using Qt. It seems to be way more well thought out, maybe because it is commercial.

## Software Decision

Let's continue with my software decision making using a AHP. Recall that I got this far yesterday:

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example01.png)

Let's rearrange the level of alternatives:

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example03.png)

Now I have 16 different pairwise comparisons to make starting with the comparison of the four alternatives under "Reasonable Scale."

The results under **Reasonable Scale**:

- Project Management: 0.06.
- Decision Making: 0.54.
- OKRs: 0.23.
- Habits: 0.17.

The results under **Fun**:

- Project Management: 0.13.
- Decision Making: 0.52.
- OKRs: 0.12.
- Habits: 0.24.

The results under **Time-Saving**:

- Project Management: 0.65.

## Decisions Project

Holy cow, I started my [Decisions App](https://github.com/joelgner/decisions) and already have some traction going. This is exciting. I got the skeleton of the project worked out. The next baby step is to start the file with `__main__()` in it. I should probably read a GTK tutorial before I take this step.

> Next Baby Step: Watch an introductory video to figure out how the `__main__()` function should work.

Today is Saturday

## Hurricane Isais

Hurricane Isais is out in the gulf now somewhere around the Bahamas, moving northwest. It is supposed to skirt the east coast of Florida as a category 1 or 2 over the next few days. We are not particularly concerned over here on the west coast.

## Duolingo Update

Julie has been working so hard on her Duolingo that she got to the last league: Diamond. I have been languishing in the second to last league for quite a long time. Inspired by her, I committed myself to graduating to Diamond and have worked extra lessons this week. I'm currently in 3rd place with two days left. I only have to be in the top 10 to advance to the Diamond League.

Here are the lessons I did this morning in support of my goal (they were randomized using the `shuf -e` command):

- Workout lesson for 20 XP
- Four Japanese lessons for 60 XP
- Childhood 2 lesson for 12 XP
- Two stories for 36 XP
- Childhood 2 lesson for 13 XP
- Activity 4 lesson for 13 XP
- Workout lesson for 20 XP
- Workout lesson for 17 XP
- Activity 4 lesson for 14 XP

## 2020-08-02

Today is Sunday, and Joey was up when I awoke, so we went and did our run. It was two days overdue because of the weather and Joey being too tired yesterday. It went well. We ran for 15 minutes, walked for 3, and then ran for 5 minutes. The temperature was mild but it was humid as all get out as usual.

## Hume's Ghost

I have the idea of starting a blog or twitter account called Hume's Ghost. I asked Joey to draw a character.

## Python Logging

```python
import logging

logging.debug('This is a debug message')
logging.info('This is an info message')
logging.warning('This is a warning message')
logging.error('This is an error message')
logging.critical('This is a critical message')
```

## Progress Made on Decisions App

I made a lot of progress on the decisions app today. I was able to create a model using SQLAlchemy to save to a sqlite database.

## DecisionManager

I am contemplating a class called decision manager that will do the work of creating a new decision, we are loading one from an existing file. It will also have to be able to copy a temporary file to the new location when we do a save as.

## 2020-08-03 Arby's for Lunch

Today is Monday. I woke up well before my alarm, but not far enough ahead to get much sleep before it rang. We kind of lounged around in bed for a little while this morning. I made some small pieces of peanut butter toast in the air fryer. Then for lunch, Joey wanted to go out for fast food, and I suggested Arby's. Joey drove there with Julie and the dog. I got a Beef 'N Cheddar. I recorded the time in my Joey Driving Practice Records spreadsheet on Google Drive.

## Big Bend Dismantlement Presentation

I presented my project plan to Chip Whitworth and others today. My director Jack Prestwood was on the line, too. It went fine.

## 2020-08-04 Bowline Knot at Big Bend

Today I rode on a boat with Chris Chambers, Aaron Jackson, Amy Butler, an electrician from Zachry, and an environmental consultant by the name of Jen Mathia. She's a stone cold fox.

When we went to the intake canal, the cable for the line of buoys was attached to a pole at the south end with a piece of 1-inch diameter rope tied into big fixed loop with a bowline knot. I untied it to let the buoys loose so the boat could pass through.

When we were done and leaving, I got to tie my very first bowline in a real-life situation! It was great. I think I did a good job.

## Switched to ZODB

This is great. ZODB is great.

## Rearranged Home Office

While I was at the office today I got a bunch of stuff such as my laptop dock. When I got home, I rearranged my desk a bit. I put my laptop on the right hand side peninsula and my Mac means green on the left now. It seems like the better Feng Shui.

## Carbon Dioxide Tank Refill

Julie took our carbon dioxide tank and had it refilled today. It's good to have it again. We have been using it a lot.

## David Ostrofsky Fire

David Ostrofsky wrote me today and said that there was a fire in his pool house. He put it out with a fire extinguisher followed by a garden hose. The damage was sustained to one wall. Nobody was hurt. Scary!

I am glad I recently bought a new fire extinguisher for the porch. The nice thing about the patio is that there are not a lot of combustible materials there. It's mostly concrete aluminum and so on. Even the table is made out of metal with a stone and glass top.

## Fetlife

Julie apparently joined a website called Fetlife, although I have not joined to confirm this. She has a friend named Jenn Porter who is in the lifestyle and recommended the website. This weekend I might suggest we get on there and look around. During COVID-19 it's not really possible to meet people \*ahem\* but we could still do webcam or something.

## 2020-08-05 Running in the Morning

For the first time today I got Joey to agree to run in the morning. We had a great run and talked a lot. The run was simply a single 20-minute run. We went down Brandon Boulevard and came back that way. When we got to Mt. Carmel, we went north to the next street before doing a 180-turn and heading for home. It was cooler but still humid. There were lots of people out. Most times when we meet people, I say, "hi" to them, and some of them do not even respond. But in the morning everyone was friendly.

## Steaks on the Grill

I made steaks on the grill tonight. Julie had a big family steak night planned with sweet corn. I ate 3 pieces! The steaks were two sirloins, one filet for her, and a ribeye for me. I only ate about 1/3 of my ribeye. It was too huge.

## Fetlife Account

I created a Fetlife account called Knotenmeister or something with a photo of a knot. Waiting for Julie to create her profile.

## 2020-08-06 School Board Meeting with Doctors

Today was a Hillsborough County school board meeting, and it was the first time that they had USF and TGH doctors. I listened to some of it with Julie on the patio. The doctors were very informative and honest about the numbers. This should have been done months ago. Here it is August 5th and it's the first time we heard from specialists in the field. The specialists were not in favor of brick and mortar schools.

## Little Greek

We ordered Little Greek today. I got a gyro wrap even though I wanted an ordinary gyro in a pita pocket. But it was delicious all the same. I also got the Greek salad and potato salad. I only ate the salad, about a third of the potato salad, and half of the gyro wrap in keeping with my calorie limiting goal for weekdays.

Before the food came, we went to ABC Liquors to get a bourbon whiskey and settled on Bower Hill Barrel Reserve that was recommended by the manager. It was pretty harsh when taken neat, but not bad in Julie's Old Fashioned Cocktail.

## 2020-08-07 Eye Appointment

Tommy and I had eye appointments at Pearl Vision today. We were instructed to call them from the parking lot so they could let us in which is exactly what happened. Tommy's eyes changed some, and I ordered him new lenses but kept the same frames to save money. My prescription changed a little, but the doctor advised me that if I changed them my reading would get worse. She suggested staying at the same prescriptions, so I did. I ordered a year's supply of new lenses.

## Beyond Burgers

We had beyond burgers for dinner. Tommy cooked them under my direction.

## Acceptable Practice

I found this figure in Reliability of Structures by Nowak and Collins (2000) and found it fascinating.

![Acceptable Practice](images/acceptable-practice.png)

I can say in all honesty that I only worry about two of the error types:

- Error of concept, where I don't notice that I am ignorant of something and,

- Error of execution, where I make a mistake in calculations or something.

I am simply too conscientious to make the other errors.

![A Fault Tree for Concrete](images/fault-tree.png)

## New Concept of Success

In the following, I will use system to represent an organization.

What if the system's success was measured as the sum of the opinions of its stakeholders? Or more rightly, maybe it should be the degree to which the stakeholder's opinion is positive. It should be weighted by the influence that the stakeholder's satisfaction or dissatisfaction has over the continued operation of the system.

Each stakeholder demands one or more things from the system. The shareholders demand return on investment. Or perhaps they demand the feeling of certainty that there will be future return on investment. Employees demand as high of pay as possible, confidence in their own safety, job security, personal fulfillment, enjoyment of time spent at work.

But let's think about the word reliable. If something is reliable, you can count on the fact that its capacity will be there when demanded. It's even easier than that. A person _expects_ that everything will fail at some point. After all, they expect to die, so they expect that their demand to continue living will not be supplied by their own body in the future. So humans are okay with failure, just - not too soon.

If they buy a car, they do not think it was a bad purchase if the car lasts 12 years. But if it's irreparably inoperable within 4 months, they will want their money back.

Now we can go back to our thoughts about reliability and update them. Something is reliable if supply meets or exceeds demand for at least as long as the stakeholder expects. It does so efficiently if it just _barely_ meets demand the entire time. That's too much to hope for, but we can say that we want to minimize the gap between demand and supply as long as supply remains on top. Why is this? It's because supply costs money. Or more rightly, supply consumes resources. Because money is exchanged for goods and services. Resources, then, are just the goods and services.

I think the right way to think about the success of a system is this:

> Is the system capable of suppling enough for all the demands on it sufficiently to continue to survive?

If it does not meet demand, it will die. Here die can mean different things for different systems. For a living system, the word die is obvious. For a business, it means to go out of business. For a machine, it means get thrown away. For a machine _design_ it means continued to be actively used.

Maybe this is what the viability axiom is about. A system fails to be a system if it dies. It's not a dead system -- it is not a system at all. Maybe this is what really defines a system.

**A system is a set of components that interact to supply the demand of one or more stakeholders well enough in the opinion of a stakeholder for the stakeholder to keep it in their service.**

By this definition, once it is destroyed or disposed of, it ceases to be a system. I think this is OK. It's like saying a living thing is no longer that thing after it dies. Thus a system is a living thing. A living thing is a system.

A natural system is the same thing, except without a stakeholder. Why is this? Because for a natural system, continued existence is an axiom.

Maybe that's the definition of a human. A human is the only living thing that can make a non-natural system. Or maybe their existence is hierarchically subordinate to humans existing.

It's not that their systems are not "natural" meaning not belonging to the natural world. It means that their systems' existence is based upon their own subjective judgement.

A system is an instance of something which was created by an existing system and has until now kept itself operating.

So let's take a particular cordless screwdriver. I mean one single one that was produced by a manufacturer and ended up on a shelf. I don't mean a make or model. The instance of the screwdriver was produced by a system: a business created by humans. It was also produced by a set of machines and tools that were created by humans. At the end of the day, all the systems created by humans are technology. The humans are natural, but their output is what we call technology. But what about beaver technology? I think it's okay to also call that technology.

I would fight the temptation to consider a system to be the _idea_ of a cordless screwdriver. It should be thought of as the _physical manifestation_ of the idea of a cordless screwdriver. An idea is only real because it is carried in the heads of real beings. If all the beings that held that idea died, and it was not recorded in a way that could be retrieved later, it would be annihilated. I don't mean killed; I mean annihilated -- just the same as the world was before it ever existed.

The design of a cordless screwdriver is also a system. As long as it continues to be used and kept in service, it continues to be a system.

Maybe that's the difference between dead and annihilated. Dead means the world is different than it was before it existed. Annihilated means the world is no different than it would have been had it never existed. Or the world has no memory of it having existed before. The life force of the body is annihilated. The physical body is dead.

## 2020-08-08 Axis and Allies Practice Round Finale

Today we finished the Axis and Allies game we started. It ended when the British successfully attacked Japan. The Japanese did distinguish themselves, however, by somehow conquering Brazil.

Dad: Russia, United Kingdom, and United States.

Tommy: Germany.

Joey: Japan.

Today is Saturday.

## Maximize Value of the Organization.

The goal of management should be to maximize the value of the organization. This is not easy because value is in the eye of the beholder. Who should decide if we are adding value?

## Benefit-Cost Analysis Steps

1. Define the problem. What is the dilemma we are facing?

1. Identify possible alternatives, always including "do nothing."

1. For each benefit, estimate the benefits, $B$, and estimate the costs, $C$, and use them to calculate the net benefits $(B - C)$. Discount costs back to a common time period such as _the present_.

1. Compare $(B-C)$ for each option including "do nothing."

1. Select the best option which is the one with the greatest net benefits $(B - C)$.

## 2020-08-09 Third Run

We did the third run of the day today. It was one 25-minute run. To make sure Joey was ready this time, I asked him to drink some water and waited a half hour before departing. We went down Brandon Boulevard to Valrico Road, ran north to the bottom of the hill, then turned around and went back. It was only about 84 degrees, but it was quite humid, and the sun was beating down. We did it successfully.

## Cleaning

Today I did my weekly Sunday cleaning routine, cleaning for 1 hours. Here's what I did:

- Vacuumed Master Suite
- Vacuumed living room
- Vacuumed family room
- Vacuumed kitchen
- Vacuumed hall outside the kids' room.
- Cleaned the kids' mirror.
- Cleaned the front door and side light windows.
- Sorted objects from the living room and family room.
- Processed my In Box.
- Removed the table top and stool tops from the old round table.

## Lunch

For lunch we had grilled chicken with Open Pit barbecue sauce and Rice-A-Roni. This time I cooked the chicken a little different. I set up the grill for indirect cooking, but then I cooked the chicken about half the time directly. Only toward the end when I was basting them in sauce did I move them to the indirect area of the grill. I think the chicken turned out better than the last few times.

## Animal Simulator

I've been playing around with an animal simulator in Python.

## 2020-08-10

## DeYoung Job Change

Tom DeYoung told me today that last Monday Jack Prestwood and Tom Berry told him he is being moved from OPM to the Contracts group to work under Gordon Griffeth. He said he was unhappy about it.

For me this means the Dismantlement will be mine entirely for the foreseeable future.

## 2020-08-11 Fireworks Incident

There was a new fireworks incident tonight. We have been having trouble with an inconsiderate neighbor lighting off fireworks at all hours of the night. Julie has been active writing on the local Brentwood Hills Facebook page about it, and many other neighbors share our displeasure. She drove around the block to confirm the house and ran into several neighbors. One was menacing with a pipe or stick. They were all pissed off at the same neighbor. Everyone seems helpless. Apparently that neighbor even fired a gun in the neighborhood and may have even struck someone's garage or house! But nobody was arrested. The police around here are obviously incompetent or don't care.

## Python Serialization Options

1. **Pickle** - No good because it can expose you to security risk. Someone can inject code that will allow them to gain access to your machine.

1. **Shelve** - Same problem as Pickle, because it uses Pickle on the backend.

1. **Marshal** - Same problem as Pickle. Used mostly internally by Python.

1. **dbm** - Whoosh, this one is something weird from GNU that is over my head.

## Axis and Allies Python Package

I started a Python package today and made the first commit to the Github repository:

<https://github.com/joelegner/axis-and-allies>

It runs many simulations of battles and tells you who won the most out of all the attempts.

Example battle report for 2 armor and 2 infantry attacking 4 infantry:

```

Attacker probability 0.573 with average of 1.21 units left, defender 0.427 with average of 0.78 units left.
```

I can use it to experiment a little. What does the attacker's winning percentage do if I add 1 more armor?

```
2020-08-12 08:25:22.555412
************Start run #1 of 1000

in 1000 battles the attackers won 883 times and the defenders won 117 times in an average of 2.71 rounds.
Attacker probability 0.883 with average of 2.59 units left, defender 0.117 with average of 0.15 units left.
```

This time the attacker won 88% of the time. With only 2 armor, the winning percentage was 57%. Adding an armor made a big difference.

## 2020-08-12 Dark Mode

I changed `pandoc.css` to make it dark mode. Here's what it looks like in case I change it in the future.

## 2020-08-14 Second to Last Run

Today is Friday. Last night around 9 pm I gave Joey one of the over-the-counter sleeping pills hoping he would be able to rouse himself today for our second to last run. He did get up on time, and we did our run. We ran through the neighborhood directly south of us and talked mostly about Mad Max films along the way. It was a good run. We ran for 30 minutes straight. That was the amount of time of the final run for the Couch-to-5K program I did 10 years ago. The current program has us run 35 minutes on the last day. We are scheduled to do that run on Sunday.

## Electricity and Human Motivation

Electricity flows through a conductor when there is a difference in charge between the two ends. This circumstance is alternately called:

- Difference in potential
- Voltage
- Electromotive force

My understanding of electricity is primitive and fairly naive, but it's close enough for what I'm about to say. Perhaps as I learn more about electricity the following analogy will be improved upon.

Maybe similarly humans are motivated by a difference in emotions. In this analogy:

- Conductor = length of time
- Let time be represented by $t$ where $t=0$ is the present moment, $t>0$ is the future, and $t<0$ is the past. Note that only $t=0$ truly exists. The others are in your head.
- An emotion exists at $t=0$, call it $E_0$. 
- A perceived future emotion exists at time $t$, $E_t$. This emotion is felt by the body as excitement, fear, longing, curiosity, or other action-inducing emotions.
- A person is motivated to act when $E_0 \neq E_t$.
- A person is not motivated to act when $E_0 \approx E_t$. They do not want things to be different than they are now. It is the state of contentedness. This is the Buddha's state of mind. How he achieved it is kind of outlined below.

Maybe we could call this difference in potential the **emotional-motivational force**. Perhaps it would be: $F = E_t - E_0$.

We can let positive emotions have a positive sign and negative emotions have a negative sign.

- An emotion is positive when $E_i > 0$.
- An emotion is negative when $E_i < 0$.
- An emotion is neutral when $E_i \approx 0$.  I use approximately because it's probably not possible to achieve perfect neutrality unless you are the Buddha.

While a Buddhist monk is sitting breathing for long periods of time, the monk's $F = 0$, presumably because $E_0 \approx 0$ and $E_t$ is undefined, because they are not thinking about the future. They are in the moment.

**Note:** Somebody has probably already thought of all this. I cannot recall ever having seen it, but I might have and forgot the incident.

## Virtual Happy Hour

I hosted a virtual happy hour for TECO employees tonight. Only a few showed up: Veronica, Paul, David, Amy, and me and Julie. It was so-so. At the end Julie did some Mad Gab cards for David, Paul, and Kristen, and that part was the best part. 

We ordered pizzas again, and we are going to order them on Sunday, too when Joey and I complete our last run.

## 2020-08-15 Kayaking

Today is Saturday. I got up and cleaned the kitchen. Well, I did about a 90% job on it including all the dishes but not the counters. It was kind of messy from last night's shenanigans.

Julie and I went kayaking in the two little kayaks. We left around 10:30 am and got back home around 1:30 pm. It was fun. We went to a spring way back in the trees and met three mermaids. Not really, but they were three attractive women in their 30s to 50s. Two of them had huge fake tits. They said they lived in Lakeland, and I think the third one on the right was flirting with us just a little. She got too excited when we said our names were Joe and Julie. "J and J!" she hollered excitedly to her friends. It was just enough to make me wonder.

Julie is thoughtful and brought a lot of good snacks including some Lil Smokies she prepared ahead of time.

## Fishing License

I bought us two fishing licenses today.

## 2020-08-16 The Last Run!

We did the last run today! It was 35 minutes long. We left the house close to 9:00 am, and it was very humid but only about 84 degrees F. 

After we completed the run, I ordered Joey some "real running shoes" as I had promised him when we undertook this adventure. We are also supposed to get Pizza Hut tonight to celebrate. It's Joey's favorite food.

## LegLib on PyPi

For the first time in my life I added a package to PyPi.

<https://pypi.org/project/leglib/0.0.4/>

![First PyPi Package: leglib 0.0.4](images/leglib-pypi.png)



## 2020-08-18 Start of Vacation

My vacation started at the end of the work day. I got out the fishing poles and tackle box and tidied up a bit. Then I helped Joey with his Crosman pistol.

## Crosman Pistol O-Ring

We had ordered some .22 pellets for an old Crossman pistol that Terry gave the boys. It is a Crosman Mark 1 Target pistol. We received the pellets today. Joe and I tried to install a cartridge, but the O-ring was old, brittle, and cracked. All the gas leaked out.

![Crosman Pistol O-Ring Measurements](images/crosman-o-ring-measurements.png)

It looks like the outside diameter is about 3/4-inch and the width is 3/32-inch.

I found a chart of O-rings on the [allorings.com website](https://www.allorings.com/userAssets/file/USAStandardSizes02.pdf) and entered it using 3/32 = 0.09375 for the value of C.S. and 3/4 = 0.750 for the value of O.D.

Here are the options and the error in the measurements:

**Size 113**: C.S. = 0.103 inch and O.D. = 0.755 inch. The error for C.S. then is $|0.103 - 0.09375|/0.103 \times 100 = 9$ percent and the error for O.D. is $(0.755 - 0.750)/0.755 \times 100 = 0.7$ percent. Not bad.

**Size 016**: C.S. = 0.70 inch and O.D. = 0.754 inch. The error for C.S. then is $|0.070 - 0.09375|/0.070 \times 100 = 34$ percent and the error for O.D. is $(0.754 - 0.750)/0.754 \times 100 = 0.5$ percent.

Visually it looks like it could be a little over 3/32 inch anyway, so I think Size 113 is the correct size.

![O-ring Size 113](images/o-ring-order.png)

## OBS Install

I am going to help Julie get better sound and video on her OBS. I downloaded it today and installed it.

![OBS Auto-Configuration Wizard Results](images/obs-auto-config-2020-08-18.png)

## OBS Audio Settings

Here are some tips I've already gleaned from watching YouTube videos.

- Add noise gate if in a loud environment. This would probably be appropriate for me with Julie. The Close Threshold should be a little higher than the Open Threshold.
- In a somewhat noisy background, use noise suppression.
- Add compressor. Leave the defaults.
- Peak level should be -3 dB. Zero is the far right. To get to the -3 dB, add a Gain filter.
- Last filter we need is the limiter. The threshold should be -3 dB.

## 2020-08-19 Trip to Anna Maria Island

Today is Wednesday, and I am on vacation -- well, we call it Paid Time Off (PTO) at TECO.

Julie made bacon and three eggs for me which I ate right after I practiced my Duolingo and Anki. I paused damage on Habitica by resting at the Tavern.

## 2020-08-26 The Most Important Lesson

The most important lesson is that the fear of suffering is already suffering. So you should never fear. You can trust that you will not _try_ to do something that causes suffering. If you believe this, you will trust yourself and need not fear the suffering.

> Let me take fear of failure as an example.  I know right now, as you’re reading this, you’re dreaming of something.  You long for a change.

> You’re imagining what life could be like “if” you could have all that you dreamed of.

> But you’re terrified of trying, because by trying you might, just might, not get there and failing for you is just not an option. You’re worried what ‘people’ might think.  You’re scared you’ll be judged.  You’re also petrified that your own high standards won’t be met.

> And so, you do nothing at all.
Because if you tried and failed, well you’d be right back to where you are now.
Which is exactly the same place that you’re terrified of being if you don’t succeed.

- Don't be afraid of others judging you negatively or you will already be suffering.

- Don't be afraid of judging yourself negatively or you will already be suffering.

- Don't be afraid of others Julie you negatively or you will already be suffering.

This is probably what **anxiety** is all about: people suffering because they are always afraid of future suffering of any kind, even suffering because you are afraid. Do not be afraid, and you will not suffer.

When you feel like saying, "Oh no, I will forget this," you are already suffering. If you worry your future self will say, "Boy, was I stupid," you are already suffering. Confidence is feeling you will succeed, even when you cannot be sure, because you do not fear the uncertainty. You live in the now.

You should fantasize, but only if you can do it without fear that it will never come true. Again, this is confidence. It's wanting without demanding. It's wanting, but being open to not getting.

Being afraid of being too empathetic is already suffering.

Thinking of the next right thing to do rationally is not based upon fear.# 2020-08-27 First Run after Couch to 5K

I was finally able to get Joey up actually he got up at a reasonable hour this morning, so we went running. We looked at his app, and found that we ran 3.2 miles in 30 minutes. So rather than run 35 minutes, we just ran for 30 minutes. It was good, we talked a little bit about meditation and anxiety and subjects like that. When we got home, Julie made Sriracha bacon in the oven. Then I got to work.


## 2020-08-29 Barbells

I have been trying to help Joey with a few different things, one of them being working out with weights. He wants to get more muscular. But with the pandemic, home weight sets have been hard to come by. A day or two ago, Joey asked about the weights again and was disappointed when I told him the barbell and weights order had been canceled by the seller. Today I decided to check online once again for weight sets. Most have been sold out now for months. I got lucky and found a set in a Dick's Sporting Goods in Lakeland, Florida!  I was so excited that I knocked on Joey's door and woke him up. I asked him to go with me to pick it up, but he said he was too sleepy to drive. I drove to Lakeland and picked up the weights. When I got back, I put them in the area we have arranged for the weights.

At some point in the day, I also checked on the status of the weight rack I had ordered. The order had a sketchy history. I ordered it, and they said on July 31 that it was delivered. But Julie and I were away from the house that day kayaking, so I became worried that it had been stolen. There were similar thefts in the area. I wrote to the seller.

The seller came back and said they checked their records and that we had been given the wrong tracking number. They said the package was about to arrive in their warehouse, and I would receive an update. This was on August 7.

By today, August 29, I had not received any update. I emailed them through Amazon and waited about 4 hours for a reply. Receiving none, I submitted a request for refund. As they had already admitted to not delivering the item, I included the text of their email in my request to Amazon. It could take a week to process.

## 2020-09-01 Qt Designer

I decided to try to move forward my Decisions project, and boy I'm sure glad I did, because I found out that Qt Designer is already installed on my machine.

```zsh
$ open /usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.15.0/libexec/Designer.app
```

And voila!

![Qt Designer Screen on Mac Mini](images/qt-designer-screen.png)

## 2020-09-02 Morning Run

I woke up around 4:30 am, fell back asleep, had some vivid dreams that I do not recall now, and then woke up again around 7:45 am. I knocked on Joey's door, and he agreed to go run. I also woke up Tommy for his 8:40 am class. Julie was asleep.


## 2020-09-03 Hiragana Font Search

I found a good Hiragana font today called **Arial Unicode MS**.

You can make this default in Microsoft Word by doing the following:

Home -> Normal Style (right click) -> Modify -> Format -> Font

Then set Asian text font to Arial Unicode MS.

## Letter to Band Director

We do not intend to send Tommy to in-person band rehearsals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Please advise what this means for him and his band career.

## 2020-09-05 First Principles

What do I believe without question?

1. There is a physical universe.

1. Time only moves forward.

## Causation

For an event A to _cause_ an event B, the following must be true:

1. A occurs prior to B in time.

1. There is a chain of physical connections between the matter involved in event A and the matter involved in event B.

## 2020-09-08 Upgrade to Windows 10

Today I called the TECO service desk to upgrade my RISA-3D software. This took forever, because the hard drive was almost full, and the help desk guy had to do some disk cleanup operations that went slowly. Eventually he checked the Windows version and found it to be out of date. How that happens, I have no idea. It does updates all the time.

We did get RISA-3D installed, and he started the Windows 10 upgrade around 11:35 am. It is now 12:45 pm, and it has barely got started. I may be without a laptop all afternoon at this rate.

## 2020-09-10 Career Path Issue

Today they announced that (a) my boss Tom Berry is retiring and (b) they are replacing him with Chris Steele, the current manager of Bayside. This is a severe blow to my ego. I have been striving to be the replacement for Tom. I would feel better if at least I got the chance to bid and interview for the position. Here I sit with 25 years of engineering and project experience, and now I will be reporting to a guy who is 7 years younger than me with little to no engineering design experience.

## Strong Lifts 5x5 Day 3

Joey and I have been doing Strong Lifts 5x5 this week. We worked out Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Here are our weights:

1. Squat: Empty Bar

1. Bench Press: Empty Bar

1. Dead Lift: Bar + 2x5 lbs

1. Shoulder Press: 15 lb dumbbells

1. Bent Over Row: 15 lb dumbbells

## 2020-09-12 Kayak Trailer

We wanted to to go kayaking today, but with three kayaks it is hard to get them all in the car. So we talked about getting a trailer. We went to Dick's Sporting Goods and got paddles for the kids, and then went to Bass Pro shops to look at trailers. They did not have any in stock.

We found a trailer online in St. Petersburg, but since we do not have a wiring harness, Julie went to U-Haul to get one installed. The U-Haul and Brandon did not have the harness in stock, so Julie had to drive to Tampa to get a harness for the car.

But Tampa location does not have a technician capable of installing the harness. That meant Julie had to go back to the Brandon location to have it installed in time for us to get to St. Petersburg together trailer!

Then we drove to St. Pete to get the trailer. What a day.

## Got Qt Designer Working in VS Code

I installed Qt for Python extension and made this setting:

```
"qtForPython.path.designer": "/usr/local/cellar/qt/5.15.0/libexec/Designer.app/Contents/MacOS/Designer"
```

## 2020-09-14 Second Week of Strong Lifts

Joey and I did our Strong Lifts 5x5 this morning. It is Day B of the program, week two. He is doing well. He has good form -- and I'm proud I taught him so well. We started with very light weights. Joey is pretty scrawny, so we want to start slow.

## Animal Simulation Thoughts

- Each animal should have a reservoir of energy. 

- Energy is derived from food sources: plants or other animals. 

- A larger body requires more energy. There is probably a power law for this.

- There would be losses of energy in each feeding. Only a fraction of the energy stored in the body would get added to the predator's body.

- There would be sensing capabilities.

An animal's day would include either resting all day or hunting for food or courting (hunting) a mate. 

```python

class Animal:

    def __init__(self):
        self.energy = 0     # kilojoules
        self.x = 0          # meters
        self.y = 0          # meters
        self.z = 0          # meters
        self.mass = 0       # kilograms
        self.volume = 0     # cubic meters
        # self.z = for flight later

```# 2020-09-15 

If I was going to model an engineering calculation, I would want to model it like this:

```
    Cover
    Frontmatter
        Table of Contents
    Mainmatter
        Section
            Paragraph
            Paragraph
        Section
            Section
                Paragraph
                Paragraph
                Paragraph
            Section
                Paragraph
    Backmatter
        Index
```

A `paragraph` could be a few sentences in prose or it could be a mathematical equation.

The way the thing could work would be like this. For any one problem you would need the problem input, a procedure, a series of templates for steps in the procedure, and an engine for doing the processing.

There would be a procedure to design a steel beam under a certain edition of the AISC Specification, for example. It might be very complex, for it needs to be able to branch off for hollow structural sections, wide flanges, angles, etc. 

A procedure can depend upon another procedure. For example, the flexural design procedure may depend on the section categorization procedure (compact, non-compact, etc. at the same time as the axial design procedure and the flexural analysis procedure.

A procedure has two kinds of requirements: its own, and the requirements of its dependencies (sub-procedures).

```zsh
$ python -m pycalcs input.yml > output.md
$ pandoc ... output.md -o output.pdf
```

The steps involved in this could be the major components.

1. Parse the input file into input data.
2. Select the design procedure called for in the input file.
3. Go through the procedure, using the input data.

The main triage section only needs to know what version of the program you are expecting and what design procedure you need. The rest of the input file contents are data for the procedure. They will be validated against the requirements of the procedure: the procedure input specification.

Input can be complex like a YAML document. The first step of the solution engine is to validate the input and throw an error if it is invalid.

```python
def parse(input_file):
    input_data, procedure_name = process_yml_file(input_file)
    return input_data, procedure_name

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_data, procedure_name = parse(input_file)
    procedure = __import__(procedure_name)

    if procedure.validate(input_data):
        output_data = procedure.run(input_data)
        procedure.report(output_data)
```

The `input_data` should be a `__dict__` that was converted from the YAML file. 

The `output_data` could be a `__dict__` or maybe JSON that could be parsed as part of a report template system.

What would an input file look like?

```yaml
procedure: DesignSteelBeam
version: 1.0
code: AISC 13th Edition
beam: 
```# 2020-09-19 Thoughts on Functional Programming

I have been interested in Functional Programming lately. My language of choice is of course Python. How would Functional Programming look in Python?

Could the program be such that it takes one argument, say a filename as an input and then returns a result, say a report string?

```
result = f(filename)
```

Could we connect it with Pandoc to create a PDF?

```zsh
$ program(filename) > result.md
$ source venv/bin/activate && pandoc -f markdown+implicit_figures  --filter pandoc-fignos result.md -o result.pdf
```

## 2020-09-20 Living on a Boat

What if we lived on a boat instead of in a house or apartment (condo)? How much would it cost? Could we really do it? Would we have to sell our current house?

There would be two states of living on the boat:
- Living docked at a marina.
- Living sailing or anchored not at a marina.

When living at a marina, you would have access to restaurants, virtually unlimited fresh water, electricity, the Internet, health care, 

These local marinas allow people to sleep overnight.

1. Blind Pass Marina, St. Pete Beach
1. Gulfport Municipal Marina, Gulfport
1. Harborage Marina, St. Petersburg
1. Longboat Key Marina, Longboat Key
1. Parrot Cove Marina, Bradenton
1. Pasadena Marina, St. Petersburg
1. Regatta Pointe Marina, Bradenton
1. Riviera Dunes Marina, Palmetto
1. St. Petersburg Municipal Marina, St. Pete
1. Twin Dolphin Marina, Bradenton 

Suppose we lived in each for 365/10 = 36.5 days a year each?

## 2020-09-21

Today is Monday. I woke up before 6:00 and got up around 7:00. I woke up Joey to work out, but he apparently fell back asleep, because it is now 8:13, and I have not seen him come out dressed and ready to work out. I guess we will have to do it either over lunch or after work.

## Requirements, Processes, and Deliverables

One way to think about a project is to think of the project organization as a set of processes that transform inputs into outputs. For a project, the inputs are the requirements. You can broadly think of anything that limits or directs project activities as a "requirement." 

Perhaps a requirement is anything that affects the production of a deliverable or creates the need for a new deliverable.

![The Project Organization](images/reqirements-processes-deliverables.png)

A written requirement can import other requirements. So adding the requirement that the design meet a written design criteria incorporates all the requirements in the design criteria document.

## 2020-09-23 Disillusioned at Work

I am disillusioned with my career right now. My goal had been to set myself up to take over for Tom Berry when he retires. I felt like there was some support for this from leadership. The Vice President of Energy Supply, Dave Pickles has been mentoring me. I had a great showing at the Challenge Team and garnered some praise from company officers. I led the early Tom Berry meetings and set up the Plan of the Week system for his employees. I did SafeStart and was visible across Energy Supply. And yet despite all this when Tom Berry's retirement announcement was made, it came together with the announcement that Chris Steele would be replacing him. Nobody talked to me.

Now my short-term career goal is gone, and whats worse is that I will now be reporting to the man who took the position I desperately wanted. His first two moves are exactly the first two moves I wanted to do that Tom Berry so blatantly did not do: meet with the customers and listen to them and meet with the staff and listen to them.

Thinking this through like a problem, what is the problem I am trying to solve?

I guess the problem is to devise a new plan to obtain a position where I think I can make a difference. I cannot make a difference where I am right now.

## Moving to New Zealand

I looked up the top 10 countries with the best standard of living, and all the top 10 except New Zealand are pretty much cold climate Northern European countries. New Zealand is also an island, so a little like Florida -- a peninsula. Here are some random thoughts about it:

1. I would not want to move before Tommy is out of high school. I wonder what colleges are in New Zealand?

1. We would have to do some research about how to get a work visa to go there. 

1. What if we formulated a plan to buy a nice boat, learn to sail it safely, and then when the day comes in a few years, sail it to New Zealand and start a new life there?

1. I did a quick search for "structural engineer" on a New Zealand job board today and got 

1. Might consider seeking a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification to bolster my already pretty strong resume.

## Organization of Boeing 747 Manual

The other day during one of my downtimes ("time wasting time") I suddenly got the urge to Google a Boeing 747 manual. I figured that a company like Boeing with such incredible excellence that they can design fighter planes and spaceships would write a really good manual. Boy I was not disappointed one bit. The thing is a masterpiece. It's the best manual I've ever seen.

# Seneca the Younger on the Terrors of Death

Here is one on death that I like. It is from this letter the translator called, ["On the Terrors of Death"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_4).

> 1. Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace with itself. Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the time when you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when one's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.

He seems to be advising the reader to continue his philosophical pursuits. This jives pretty well with my "Lifelong Learner" identity I am cultivating by doing things like reading the letters of Seneca the Younger.

> 2. You remember, of course, what joy you felt when you laid aside the garments of boyhood and donned the man's toga, and were escorted to the forum; nevertheless, you may look for a still greater joy when you have laid aside the mind of boyhood and when wisdom has enrolled you among men. For it is not boyhood that still stays with us, but something worse, – boyishness. And this condition is all the more serious because we possess the authority of old age, together with the follies of boyhood, yea, even the follies of infancy. Boys fear trifles, children fear shadows, we fear both.

I like the part here where old men -- still boyish -- yet have authority. Old men fear little things and shadows. The little things are little, and the shadows are nothing.

> 3. All you need to do is to advance; you will thus understand that some things are less to be dreaded, precisely because they inspire us with great fear.

I'm not sure what he is getting at here. The first clause seems to be about the reader continuing to grow in wisdom by his pursuit of philosophy. That things are less to be dreaded because they inspire us with fear is interesting, but I have not worked out how I would paraphrase it.

> No evil is great which is the last evil of all. Death arrives; it would be a thing to dread, if it could remain with you. But death must either not come at all, or else must come and pass away.

The "last evil of all" must be the cause of your death. Not dreading it because it is fleeting is brilliant and poetical.

> 4. "It is difficult, however," you say, "to bring the mind to a point where it can scorn life." But do you not see what trifling reasons impel men to scorn life? One hangs himself before the door of his mistress; another hurls himself from the house-top that he may no longer be compelled to bear the taunts of a bad-tempered master; a third, to be saved from arrest after running away, drives a sword into his vitals. Do you not suppose that virtue will be as efficacious as excessive fear?

Many are those who want to die for trivial things. Likewise you can be ready for your own death. It is inevitable anyway. Might as well not fear death while life is still around.

> No man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it, or believes that living through many consulships is a great blessing. 

This is quite Buddhist sounding. He's saying that those who cling to life cannot truly enjoy it. It also reminds me of Jesus saying, "He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal" (John 12:25). I don't think this was Buddhist teaching by the author of John. It's more a carrot and a stick: if you are rich enough to enjoy your life, God will punish you in the afterlife, but if you are suffering in this life, God will make it right in the end. No wonder Christianity caught on at a time when life was worse than shitty.

> 5. Rehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to depart from life contentedly; for many men clutch and cling to life, even as those who are carried down a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks. Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die. 

Very Buddhist here and wise. This bit was what led me to do this little primitive commentary.

> 6. For this reason, make life as a whole agreeable to yourself by banishing all worry about it. No good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort than that which, when lost, cannot be missed. Therefore, encourage and toughen your spirit against the mishaps that afflict even the most powerful.

See [2020-08-26 The Most Important Lesson].

> 7. For example, the fate of Pompey was settled by a boy and a eunuch, that of Crassus by a cruel and insolent Parthian. Gaius Caesar ordered Lepidus to bare his neck for the axe of the tribune Dexter; and he himself offered his own throat to Chaerea. No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him. Do not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its depths. The very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed. 

So very true how "fate" can change in an instant.

> 8. Reflect that a highwayman or an enemy may cut your throat; and, though he is not your master, every slave wields the power of life and death over you. Therefore I declare to you: he is lord of your life that scorns his own. Think of those who have perished through plots in their own homes, slain either openly or by guile; you will then understand that just as many have been killed by angry slaves as by angry kings. What matter, therefore, how powerful he be whom you fear, when every one possesses the power which inspires your fear? 

"He is lord of your life that scorns is own" is an important lesson. The person who scorns his life is not afraid to lose it. He is not desperate, he is jaded. He is dangerous. Thinking about the world right now, there are people out there with terribly bad lives who would cause harm to others because they hate the world. To Seneca's wisdom I would add my own: try to take pity on the man who scorns his life, for he is miserable.

> 9. "But," you will say, "if you should chance to fall into the hands of the enemy, the conqueror will command that you be led away," – yes, whither you are already being led. Why do you voluntarily deceive yourself and require to be told now for the first time what fate it is that you have long been labouring under? Take my word for it: since the day you were born you are being led thither. We must ponder this thought, and thoughts of the like nature, if we desire to be calm as we await that last hour, the fear of which makes all previous hours uneasy.

Do not fear being led away to be put to death, for your life is already leading you to death since the day you were born. Do not lie to yourself: you are going to die. Better to reflect on this idea with an open mind if you want to be calm during your last moments. Otherwise, all the hours preceding this will be frought.

> 10. But I must end my letter. Let me share with you the saying which pleased me to-day. It, too, is culled from another man's Garden: "Poverty brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth." Do you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us? Merely to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. In order to banish hunger and thirst, it is not necessary for you to pay court at the doors of the purse-proud, or to submit to the stern frown, or to the kindness that humiliates; nor is it necessary for you to scour the seas, or go campaigning; nature's needs are easily provided and ready to hand.

Most of what we do is unnecessary. What is necessary is to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. Food, water, shelter, and maybe a few basics he skipped over are all we need. The rest is due to discontent. This may be a Stoic philosophy.

> 11. It is the superfluous things for which men sweat, – the superfluous things that wear our togas threadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign shores. That which is enough is ready to our hands. He who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich. Farewell.

It might be in another Seneca letter, but I recently heard the idea that you need money for the necessities of life and to buy "that which is enough." For if it is enough, you are at peace -- like the Buddha.

## 2020-10-04

What components would a structural engineering package like Enercalc need?

**Code** - An object that captures the formulas and logic of a building code and its adopted standards like AISC and ACI. Not to be confused with computer instructions (code).

**GUI** - The user interaction parts.

## 2020-10-10 Killed a Rat

We sometimes get roof rats living in our attic or on our porch. A few days ago we heard them on the metal roof over the porch, so we put out some traps. The first day with the traps they took the bait but did not get caught. The second day we got one. Not sure if there were more than one, I re-baited the trap.

The next day in the early evening when it was pretty dark, we heard the trap go off. Julie held her iPhone light so I could see while we investigated. There was a rat in the trap with the trap pinching its waist. I was about to go get a bag to throw away the corpse when Julie exclaimed, "I think it's still alive!" Sure enough, the damn thing was breathing.

I felt pity on the creature and decided to dispatch its life to put it out of its misery. I grabbed a log from our log pile and bashed in its head unceramoniously. To my horror, the thing was still apparently alive after that blow. It's hard to know if it was conscious, but it was still moving significantly. I then resolved to make sure the job got done right and bashed it over and over again. Julie was squeemish - and I was too. The rat even gave out a squeek on about the 2nd blow which added to our feelings of guilt.

I feel okay knowing that I did in good faith try to put it out of its misery and did so as quickly as I could do - I was just incompetent the first time. Next time I will make it a quick and certain death.

## 2020-10-10 Cryptocurrency

I watched a [video by 3Blue1Brown on cryptocurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDN52m7Y21ePrTbvXkPaWVSg&index=6).

You can record your transactions with friends using a **ledger**. The ledger system protocol is:

1. Anyone can add lines to the ledger.

2. At the end of the month you settle up with real money.

This system has a serious flaw: item 1 opens the door for someone to cheat the system. What keeps Bob from adding a fictitious line saying that he paid Alice $100? Nothing. It requires perfect trust.

How can we resolve the trust issue? We can impose the requirement that the person who is paying has to add their _signature_ to the line in the ledger where they are paying.

This is all well and good, but we need a way to do this digitally. The way it is done is that each person using the ledger create a **private key** and **public key** pair. The private key is sometimes also called a **secret key** so that it can be abbreviated as "SK" while "PK" is used for _public_ key. 

A digital signature is better than a real-world signatrue, becuase the digital signature is unique to each message. Your hand signature looks pretty much the same each time.

`Sign(Message, SK) = Signature`

For you to trust the system, it needs to be such that there is no way to verify the message is authrorized if you do not know the secret (or private) key.

`Verify(Message, Signature, PK) = True or False`

How do we make sure they cannot be guessed easily? We use 256 bit security. This gives us $2^{256}$ key combinations. The ledger system also requires that each line have a unique `Message + SK` signature. That way nobody can simply duplicate lines with valid signatures.

OK, this is great so far. But we still have a problem. How do we know that someone will pay the amount of _real_ cash at the end of each month? How do we trust the settlement process? How about this: each person ponies up a "real" cash amount at the beginning of the ledger. They can add or deduct from their balance as long as it remains above zero. No overspending is allowed. For this to work, we need to know the entire history of transactions at any given time so we can determine if the next proposed transaction is valid -- does the person have the money in their account?

We could have an entire economy using the ledger now. For convenience, let's call the "fake" money in the ledger as **ledger dollars** and abbreviate them LD.

The key insight here is of course this:

> Bitcoin is a trustwrothy digital ledger.

We still have a serious problem, I'm afraid. No individual can trust that they are keeping the same ledger as everyone else in the marketplace. It is this problem that the original Bitcoin paper solved elegantly and which made cryptocurrencies viable.

The cool idea of the paper is that there is computational work. The ledger is encrypted using a SHA-256 which is bascially a 256-bit representation of a message. The `SHAF256()` function is a one-way function. It's possible to go from the message to the resulting hash, but not the other direction. And it's impossible to predict the output of the `SHA256()` function. What the paper did was this: find a number which produces a hash that starts with 30 straight zeroes. There are $2^30 \approx 1$ billion ways to combine those 30 digits. Only one of them is all zeroes. So a random number will only produce the 30 zeroes 1 time out of a billion. Since `SHA256()` is unpredictable, we must brute-force go through these billion numbers until we find one that correctly produces a hash starting with 30 zeroes. The special number is called the **proof of work** because it takes computing power to find.

A **block** is a set of transaction with the _proof of work_ number appended. It must also have the previous block's hash _prepended_. Changing any block or re-ordering them will break the chain. For example, if you swap the order of two blocks, you change the prepended hash which causes the block's hash to be totally different. Then you have to find a new _proof of work_ to get back to 30 zeroes.

## 2020-10-11 BEARS

Today I made a copy of my old BEARS project and put it under Projects on Google Drive. BEARS was my failed attempt to create a website that would allow people to design structural components like individual beams and footings. It was a Django 1.4 project. I'm not sure when I started it, but it actually worked once upon a time. I used it to design real projects, and I was always hoping it would turn into something bigger and better, but I lost motivation or something and did not follow through. There is some good work in there, so I hope to extract that value.

## BEARS Github

<https://github.com/joelegner/bears>

## BEARS System Components

BEARS had these components or modules:

- `./accounts`: User profiles, company accounts.
- `./apploads`: Applied structural loads: axial, snow drift, moment, point load, and uniform load.
- `./bears`: Settings, urls.
- `./buildings`: A Building class with lots of functions such as wind load calcs.
- `./concrete`: Concrete section, retaining wall, rebar, rebar mat.
- `./core`: Component, beam-column, Django form fields, etc. This is an important one.
- `./docs`: User and development documentation - poor level of completion.
- `./foundations`: Footing, pump foundation.
- `./lib`: Where I put `leglib` at the time.
- `./loads`: ASCE 7 stuff. Meta information about loads, not _applied_ loads.
- `./masonry`: Just a skeleton that was never implemented.
- `./projects`: Main Project class with some ancillary classes like Terrain Category.
- `./proto`: Not sure what this was about. It has files like `asce7_05.py` and `sheetpile.py`.
- `./registration_shared`: Looks like an improperly vendored-in package. Does not seem to be my own code.
- `./scripts`: Utility scripts that clean user data, create fixtures, and do nightly updates to the database.
- `./sji`: Steel joists.
- `./static`: Assets like CSS, fonts, images, and JavaScript.
- `./steel`: Structural steel. This was probably the most well-developed of the component types.
- `./templates`: Django templates.
- `./userdata`: File storage for registered users, I guess.
- `./wood`: Fairly well-developed classes like `LvLShape` and `WoodHeader` with base classes.

## Thoughts on Joe the Developer

I do not seem to stay motivated when there is not an obvious problem to solve in front of me. Back when I created the Legner Engineering Intranet site and BEARS, I was trying to solve very specific problems: how to manage a business and how to get work done efficiently and accurately so I could make money. Now I work for the power company. I don't have to worry about the business as much. And I don't really design anything. So I've been toying around with ideas like a dueling pianos app. But that one kind of died on the vine - first because I set it aside to finish my Master's degree and then because COVID-19 made it seem not as value-added with little to no dueling shows occurring.


## 2020-10-13 Sailboat Shopping

There are way more monohulls than catamarans for sale - at least an order of magnitude. I found a few listings that were not miles off from what we would want. Source websites:

<https://www.smartmarineguide.com/boats-for-sale-in-st_petersburg-florida>

Assumptions for payment estimates:
- 20% downpayment
- 5% interest
- 20-year loan

> Monthly Payment = $6.60 per $1000 financed.

- $25K would be $165 per month.
- $50K would be $330 per month.
- $75K would be $495 per month.
- $100K would be $660 per month.
- $150K would be $990 per month.
- $200K would be $1320 per month.

> Each $100 of payment will get you $15,150 in financing.

These initial assumptions should be reviewed before committing. Control against psychological _anchoring_.

One listed is a [2004 Gemini 105 MC](https://www.smartmarineguide.com/L50137904). It is 34 feet long. The asking price is $136,000. For a loan amount of $109K, the estimated payment would be $719.35 per month.

A [1992 Endeavourcat 30](https://www.calculator.net/payment-calculator.html?ctype=fixterm&cloanamount=44000&cloanterm=20&cmonthlypay=1000&cinterestrate=5&printit=0&x=44&y=22), length 30 feet. Asking price is $54,900. For a loan of $44K the monthly payment would be about $290.00 per month.

There are some pretty nice catamarans on [Boattrader.com](https://www.boattrader.com/boats/type-sail/class-sail-catamaran/state-fl/price-0,200000/). Looks like pretty decent ones in a range of prices centering around $150K.

Assuming a $150K purchase price, $120K loan, the monthly payment would be around $800. This is a good rule of thumb.

## 2020-10-14 Tufte

Today I changed to `tufte.css` for fun.


## 2020-10-17 Nim Language Experiment

I heard about a programming language called Nim that resembles Python but compiles to C, so it should run much faster I would think. To test this theory, I wrote the following two programs to flip a coin 1,000,000 times and report how many heads and tails were flipped.

Python version:
```python
import random

random.seed()

heads, tails = 0, 0

for i in range(0, 1000000):
    if random.randint(0, 1) == 1:
        heads = heads + 1
    else:
        tails += 1

print(f"{heads} heads and {tails} tails")
```

Nim version:
```nim
import random

var heads, tails: int = 0

randomize()

for i in countup(1, 1000000):
    if rand(1) == 1:
        heads = heads + 1
    else:
        inc(tails)

echo heads, " heads and ", tails, " tails."
```

Then I ran them and wouldn't you know it, the Nim version was much faster.

```zsh
joelegner:nim-playground/ $ time python3 flip.py                                                                                                                                           [12:50:19]
499004 heads and 500996 tails
python3 flip.py  1.12s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 1.150 total
joelegner:nim-playground/ $ time ./flip                                                                                                                                                     [8:48:39]
499336 heads and 500664 tails.
./flip  0.07s user 0.00s system 94% cpu 0.074 total
```

Python took 1.15 seconds, while Nim only took 0.074 seconds. So Python took 15 times as long to do the work.

## 2020-10-20 Thomas Jefferson on Newspapers

I found this letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Norvell almost painfully apropos for today. It harmonizes with my worldview. 

Source: <https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/amendI_speechs29.html>

> To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, "by restraining it to true facts & sound principles only." Yet I fear such a paper would find few subscribers. It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could not more compleatly deprive the nation of it's benefits, than is done by it's abandoned prostitution to falsehood. Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knolege with the lies of the day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live & die in the belief, that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time; whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables. General facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great [Volume 5, Page 170] portion of Europe to his will, &c., &c.; but no details can be relied on. I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods & errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false.

> Perhaps an editor might begin a reformation in some such way as this. Divide his paper into 4 chapters, heading the 1st, Truths. 2d, Probabilities. 3d, Possibilities. 4th, Lies. The first chapter would be very short, as it would contain little more than authentic papers, and information from such sources as the editor would be willing to risk his own reputation for their truth. The 2d would contain what, from a mature consideration of all circumstances, his judgment should conclude to be probably true. This, however, should rather contain too little than too much. The 3d & 4th should be professedly for those readers who would rather have lies for their money than the blank paper they would occupy.


## 2020-10-21 Ramblings

Regret is the pain you feel from a decision resulting in an unwanted outcome. You expected the decision to go the other way. It could be eliminated entirely if you could instill in yourself the belief that you are using good decision-making processes and uncertainty is just part of life. Buddhism would say something along the lines that your expectation led to the pain. If you eliminate the expectation, you eliminate the pain.

Being afraid to do or say something is what your planning mind expects you to feel if you do it or say it. The feeling of fear is not quite the same as pain, but it is definitely a negative emotion. You would rather not be afraid. Fear points away from action. It points to inaction or alternate action.

If you are afraid to walk on thin ice, you are imagining yourself suffering in the cold water.

What would it be like to have zero fear? Let's start there and work backwords. With zero fear, you would only be motivated by desire for something like food. I guess 

Expectation is the delusion that everything is going to work out the way you want it or better. Aspiration is the reality. You might not get what you want. Aspiration is imporant, because it gets us to strive for things. It motivates us. We are motivated to aspire to a number of simultaneous outcomes, some of which are logically contradictory. But all this insanity ends up in quite a steady state, steady enough for the body carrying it to survive in a very complicated and messed-up, human-filled world for many decades. The only thing that gives out now, growing old, may also fall victim to the march of man's knowledge. Maybe someday our ancestors will know how to live longer, even very long. It would be no contradiction for our ancestors to breed themselves to get happier and happier over the centuries, but I do not believe it will happen.

We should do everything in our power to spread ideas that increase happiness. Any idea that increases happiness without reducing the happiness of another is a step in the right direction. We take baby steps. We see if this direction looks promising, and we go there and then take stock of everyone's happyiness level. If it moved up, we are content. The amount of joy that the happyiness generates should be integrated over time for all people. The idea you want people to have is that they should make other people happy as often as possible, which is to say they should be kind and benevolent. If this got going and really spread, it would change the world. Kindness should have a feedback loop with happiness, too, because it feels good to be kind. It also feels good to get back at someone. The first motive is better, because it makes two people happy. The second motive only makes you happy. I guess maybe a friend would be happy for you, but that chain is going to go off to infinity. We should stick with worrying about the primary beneficiary or victim of the act. 

## 2020-10-23 Twenty-First Anniversary

Today is our 21st anniversary. We are happy and healthy and living at 819 Walsingham Way, Valrico, Florida. Today is Friday, and it was a beautiful day all day long. I took the afternoon off to celebrate. After work around 11:30 we went to Bloomingdale Public Library to cast our ballots for the 2020 election. We both voted for Joe Biden for President. We also ate at the new Tiki place in Riverview. It was pretty good.


## 2020-10-27 Started Packing for Camping

Over the weekend I installed planks on our new kayak trailer to support cargo. Today after work Julie and I got out the camping stuff and started sorting and organizing it for the trip. I printed my camping checklist that is now in its 21st year of existence. Pretty cool.

## 2020-11-02 Camping

We got back home from camping yesterday. Here is a little rundown of highlights. I did not have my phone on my the entire time during the trip, so I did not take any photos, although I think Julie did.

Tommy got really overheated and cranky the first day. He is not aclimated to hot weather, because he sits at his computer all day and never goes outside. We had to make him rest and drink a lot of fluids while we kept setting up things.

We went kayaking a few times, and Julie and I tried to fish but not for more than about 30 minutes. We did not have any bait, and we were trying to use hot dogs -- I've never had much luck with hot dogs as bait. I bought a 3-pound anchor for the orange kayak and a 50-foot anchor rope. The anchor may be a little too light to anchor even the kayaks in a light breeze. Oh well, live and learn.

On Halloween Night we got a few trick-or-treaters. We set up chairs by the road at the entrance to the campsite and let the kids take a piece of candy or two. Joey dressed up as an English explorer with his pith helmet, gun holster, and a straight-bladed Buck knife we bought for him at Bass Pro Shops on the way to the campground.

## 2020-11-04 Joey Made Spaghetti

At the end of the day today, Joey made the spaghetti meal for the family. Tommy helped too, especially with the noodles. It was really good!

## Work Stuff

My office for the past few years has been in a construction trailer called Trailer C at Big Bend Station. Recently the company decided to move us around, so I went in today to get my stuff and take it to my new office in the adjacent MCS Building. Unfortunately the movers had taken my desk and unceramoniously put all my stuff in random boxes. What a hassle it will be to sort it all out again.

My new manager Chris Steele is turning out to be a good improvement over my old boss Tom Berry. He wants me to lead the work on developing a project methodology for the department which could later turn into a methodology for the entire Energy Supply business unit. This could be a great break for me.


## 2020-11-07 Great Day

Today was a Saturday, and it was a great day.

I got up early and did the dishes. I noticed all the Halloween decorations stacked in crates that should be in the attic, and it reminded me that the attic stairs broke. So I got a wild hair and decided to replace the stairs.

The project was a big one for me. It took probably about 6 hours to complete. I was proud of every step except the one where I put my foot through the drywall. That sucked. But the new stair is great, and it is aluminum so it should be less likely to fail than the cheaper wood ones like the one we had before.

In the afternoon afternoon we sat on the porch and talked to Tommy about music. He played songs he likes on a Bluetooth speaker. Then Joey came out and shot cans with his BB gun. It was quite a long time for us all to hang out like that. 

I also smoked a cigar. It was dried out, but I didn't care. It was fun, and Julie said it made me smell manly. 

In the evening we went out on a date and had a wonderful time. We sat at the bar at a new steak joint in Brandon. It was almost empty when we arrived which was nice, but it got too crowded for us later. They did not separate people at the bar. So we bowed out and went around the corner to a place which sells whisky and such. We had two glasses of whisky each.

## 2020-11-08 Sunday

Tomorrow I have a big meeting to defend my performance rating of David Ostrofsky. So today I am going to not drink at all or only drink a beer around lunchtime. I don't want to be at all groggy on Monday.

I've almost made it to the 4th checkpoint in Duolingo.

## 2020-11-10 Walked in the Morning

I had been a little lethargic the last two days, and I surmised it was because I got no exercise. I believe when my mind is tired and my body is awake, I do not sleep well. So I went for a walk / run. The weather was absolutely perfect, and I got a nice workout. My mood switched light a lightbulb. The doldrums were over just like that. I *aspire* (but not expect) to walk and run again tomorrow morning.

## Trip to Big Bend

I went to Big Bend today, partially to look at a structure for Scott Blaisdell and partially to keep unpacking and moving into my office. It was a useful day if not a productive one.

## Reading Right Now

I have been reading two written works and am totally engrossed in both. One is a book _Introduction to Probability_ by Grinstead, Snell, and Snell, and the other one is an online tutorial called [Composing Programs](https://composingprograms.com).

> A book is useful to my learning when it generates Anki cards.

I have also been listening to three audiobooks on Librivox off and on. These are more for amusement than for learning. The first is _Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant_ by Ulysses S. Grant, the second is _Good Sense_ by someone called Baron D'Holbach, and the last is Moral Letters, Vol. I by Lucias Annaeus Seneca.

## 2020-11-11 Tropical Storm Eta

A tropical storm named Eta went by in the Gulf today. Actually it rose to a Category I for a short time, which indicates 75 mph sustained 1-minute winds. But most of the day it was around 70 mph, heading for 65 mph and below in a few hours. The track took it north of us toward the Big Bend area of Florida.

## Veteran's Day

Today is Veteran's Day in the United States. Tommy had the day off from school.

## Workout in the Morning

Since yesterday's morning walk was such a smash hit, I bet myself that I would do it again today. Alas, when I got up the rain bands from Eta were already in the area. So instead I went to the back porch and under the din of rain I did jumping jacks, burpees, running in place, and lunges, with a few improvized motions thrown in for good measure. I got a pretty good heart rate and sweat going, so it definitely worked. 

## Impermanence

I had a sense of impermanence today. I was sitting at my computer around 7:45 in the evening, yawning like crazy. It felt good, because I had worked out this morning, and it felt like my body was actually tired for once. I will probably sleep well. What occurred to me was that yesterday I was a ball of energy in the evening, reading voraciously and frantically adding Anki cards to capture the knowledge. I read some things about Buddhism.  I read a book about probability. It's funny how impermanent a good day or a high-energy feeling is. Nothing lasts. Chuckling about it seems more appropriate than despairing that every day cannot be a good day.


## 2020-11-12 Carl Williams' Position Eliminated

Jack Prestwood called me today to inform me that the position of my direct report, Carl Williams, was eliminated. This was not discussed with me ahead of time. It came out of left field. He called me, but I did not have much to tell him. I told him the truth, that it was a shock to me.

My manager Chris Steele called me in the afternoon. He is traveling on Paid Time Off (PTO - our version of vacation.) He said that he was involved in the decision either, that it came down from Jack without warning, except that he knew about it yesterday afternoon rather than this morning. 

## Python Project

I so wish I had a project to develop in Python. I tried that decision making app but ran out of motivation for it.

## Writing

I like writing. I feel like I'm getting better at it. My sentences now have a flow to them that they did not seem to have before. I was always a pretty good academic writer, but what else can I write? I could try fiction. I've always threatened to. But I have these high aspirations for my first work that I don't think I can deliver. I want it to be at once a philosophical work and a moving literary masterpiece. Maybe instead I should just write _something_ and see where it goes from there.


## 2020-11-13 Health Problem

Julie experienced bleeding today for the first time in many years.

## 2020-11-16 Tommy Alegbra II

Tommy is flunking Algebra II. It's not an honors class, it's just the normal algebra class. He cannot do it remotely, and he is so far behind that he now feels it is impossible to catch up. It's only 13 hours worth of work, but he was adamant, dead-set on not doing it.

He is supremely lazy when it's something he is not interested in. I guess I was the same way in high school, but I got over it in college.

We are trying to pull him from the course now to save his GPA and enroll him in FLVS. Julie said she would run daily classes with them 5 days a week (they both have to take the same course). Tommy was resistant, but he is likely to comply once we get going.

## Restarted Workouts

Joey and I worked out today after three weeks off. I reduced the weight for each exercise we did today: squat, shoulder press, and deadlift. I'm just happy he got up and did it!

The intent is to do them on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday around 4:00 pm each day.

## Positions Eliminated at Work

I talked to Dru Latchman, a woman who works with me. She said that Tom Schmoll, Gary Garbelman, Guy Morris, Peggy Jones, and two planners at Big Bend were let go like Carl, their positions eliminated in the new scheme. I was most surprised by Gary Garbelman. I thought he was viewed as a good operations engineer. I also was a little surprised by Peggy Jones, as I had previously thought she was well-regarded. I guess not. Guy Morris was no surprise.

## 2020-11-17 Julie Doctor

Julie went to the doctor today and got checked out. The doctor wants to test her for both cervical and endromitrial cancer in early December. But the doctor said she was not worried. She also did find the Mirena which is good. But the question still remains: what caused the bleeding? It could be a ruptured cyst, but that should have been painful. It remains uncertain.

## Met with Chris Steele

I met with Chris Steele today and had a nice long conversation touching on many topics. He is still in favor of my continuing to focus on the Big Bend Dismantlement planning and process improvements. He thinks that is where I will add the most value, and I agree. The trick will be to shed these annoying little Carl projects like the Big Bend blast wall design.

## Reading Today

Since last week, I continue to read the _Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant_ and also _Good Sense_. I finished the online _Composing Programs_ book and the _Moral Letters_ audiobook.

I've added two new books this week. The first is _Introduction to Safety and Reliability of Structures (1997)_ and the other is _How to Solve it - Modern Heuristics_ by Zbigniew Michalewicz and David Fogel. The former is a mundane engineering text, and the other is a problem-solving guide.

## 2020-11-19 Engineering Units Project

I've got a vague idea to make a Python project that will handle engineering units: feet, inches, kips, pounds, kip-feet, meters, newtons, newton-meters, and so on. What do I want it to look like? Let's brainstorm the usage and see if it seems fun.

```python
>>> from units import inches, feet, psf, kips
>>> L = 10.0*feet
>>> L
10.0 ft
>>> B = 8*feet
>>> B
8.0 ft
>>> B*L
80.0 ft^2
>>> q = 100.0*psf
>>> q
100.0 psf
>>> P = q*B*L
>>> P
8000.0 lb
>>> P.convert(kips) # Changes P
>>> P
8.0 kips
>>> P.in_units(pounds) # Does not change P
8000.0 lb
>>> P 
8.0 kips
```

## Religion Quote

I like this. It is attributed to Cesar Pavese, an Italian writer.

> Religion consists in believing that everything which happens is extraordinarily important. It can never disappear from the world, precisely for this reason. 

## 2020-11-23 Backup to Toshiba

Now that I am using my Mac almost exclusively, I had to come up with a way to back up my Google Drive to my Toshiba external hard drive. I re-wrote my `backup-toshiba.sh` script, but it was not working. It turns out that NTFS disks are read-only for MacOS. So I had to reformat it as `exFAT` based on what I read here: 
<https://www.trickyways.com/2019/12/format-external-hard-drive-to-use-mac-and-pc/>

My backup script is now just a one-liner:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Back up Dropbox to external Toshiba drive
rsync -av --delete /Users/joelegner/Google\ Drive /Volumes/TOSHIBA\ EXT/backups/
```

## 2020-11-24 Packed up Carl's Office

Today I went to Big Bend first thing in the morning and packed eleven boxes of personal belongings to ship to Carl Williams. It was a big job. I tried to be conscientious about the stuff I sent him versus what I discarded or retained (company property). I wrote a little manifest in each box and photographed each open box with its manifest before sealing it and affixing the label.

She was sitting on the edge of the tub in the southeast corner, up on the edge of it out of the water. She suddenly looked funny. She tensed up for a split second, and I thought she was going to have a seizure, so I moved in close. What happened next was a shock. She just passed out, completely. It was like someone had pulled the power cord, and she went totally limp. I caught her. I was scared. A good 10 or 15 seconds passed where she was making a few gurgling sounds but not necessarily breathing.# 2020-11-25 Julie

Today Julie went shopping for THC products with her friend Tiffanie. She said she was going to go to a dispensory and come home. I think she left the house before lunch. I said I was having the leftover lasagna, and then I did not hear from her until 3:22 pm. She said she bought me "flower". At 5:33 she texted me that she had a breakthrough with Tiffanie - she had got Tiffanie to admit she was a swinger. She said, "It's nice to have a friend to talk about it." Not long after she sent me a photo of her, Tiffanie, and a bartender wearing masks with the caption, "Safe!!!!!!." I replied with a cute gif meme, and that was the last I heard from her on text at around 6:30 I reckon.

The kids and I watched _Django Unchained_ which is 2 hours and 45 minutes long. All the while, Julie was in Ybor City with Tiffanie. She finally came home I know not when, but probably close to 10:30 pm. Then she apparently sat in the driveway for almost an hour before she came in. I was in the hot tub, ready to get out. 

She proceeded to tell me about a fight she had with Tiffanie. She said she was crying in the car, talking to one of her online friends, Laurie Wiley. I could tell she was pretty drunk, but I didn't know how bad it was yet. She said Tiffanie had skirted around the issue of swinging and then clammed up, not wanting to talk. She portrayed Tiffanie in a bad light. 

We finally got in the hot tub and started relaxing. I was sitting by the controls, and she was in the southeast corner. She suddenly said, "I need to come clean about something. I kissed a guy tonight." I was flabbergasted, but I handled it rather well, I believe. Here I was all night with the kids, explaining away to Tommy that we would have to make the pear tart tomorrow, all the while trusting her. And here she is during the COVID-19 pandemic -- not only in Ybor City where the kids drink and spread COVID-19 -- not only at a bar getting drunk -- but also physically swapping spit with a total stranger.

She got really bad and dark next. She was talking about how bad of a wife she was, and how she did not deserve me. She said she thought if she could just die, I would be free of her. It was sad and distrubing. She was apologetic and weepy. I was pretty stunned and did not say much, but I was feeling very betrayed. It was not for a kiss. A kiss is rather harmless normally. But this is during the COVID-19 pandemic. She was mortified to think that she may have brought COVID-19 into our home because of her inability to control her drinking. 

She was talking and talking, all over the map about drinking, swinging, and her extremely low self-esteem. I felt bad for her. # 2020-11-28 Kayak Trip to the Gandy

We are on Day #2 of sobriety, and today we made the most of it. We loaded up the orange kayak and snacks and drinks and drove to the Gandy Causeway in St. Petersburg. We got there pretty early for a Saturday, in the water by 10:30 am. The weather could not have been more perfect. It was in the lower 80s with a light breeze and mostly sunny.

We ended up paddling a long way. Along the way we got to see a few USATONS (United States Aids to Navigation System) aids and Duke's Bartow Station which is on Weedon Island. Julie thought she saw a manatee near the Duke plant, but when we paddled over there we found nothing. 

We paddled over to some sailboats and had fun identifying all the boat parts. We have been studying the terminology using Anki cards. It was great to see our old friends like the forestay, sidestays, gunwalls, transom, etc. It really brought some of the concepts to life. And we saw the variety of different boats around.

Back at the shore, we sat in chairs partially in the water, secluded from all our neighbors by mangroves. We also did a lot of wading out in the water. The temperature of the water was so nice that we did not notice the time go by much. It was pleasant and felt healthy.

This was a good second day of sobriety.

## Kayak Trip Checklist

I created a new Kayak Trip Checklist under Google Drive / Tools / Checklists.

## Checklist App Idea

I have an idea for a checklist application. First let me give you an idea of the kind of checklist I mean.

![Example Checklist Format](images/checklist-example.png)

The structure seems to include the following.

1. A title.
1. A set of hold points: Before Engine Start, Engine Start (normal), Engine Start (flooded), ..., Shutdown.
1. A list for each hold point. Each list line item consists of:
    A. An integer number 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
    B. A noun which represents either:
        1. A physical object: seats, flaps, parking break
        1. A control selector: flap switch, oil pressure
        1. An instrument: airspeed, suction gage.
    C. The desired state of object represented by said noun: on, off, up, set, 1000 RPM, 100 MPH.

Each **checklist** contains:

- Property: Title
- Property: Author Name
- Property: Latest Date / Time
- Children: Set of $n$ hold points.

Each **hold point** contains:

- Property: hold point name
- Children: Set of $m$ line items.

Each **checklist item** (line item) contains:

- Property: Sequence number (integer)
- Property: Object (noun)
- Property: Desired state (adverb or adjective)

We will also need a way to record what happened when we used the checklist. We will call this a checklist encounter.

Each **checklist encounter** contains:

- Property: Datetime of encounter start.
- Property: Datetime of encounter end.
- Children: Set of $p$ checklist item result objects.

Each **checklist line item result** contains:

- Property: Pointer to checklist item.
- Property: Completed boolean
- Property: Datetime the box was checked.

## 2020-11-29 Backyard Table

Today we started a backyard table project. We had an old table that was made for indoors, and we had it on the porch. The table top was some kind of pressed wood crap which started getting moldy. So I discarded the old top and made plans to install a new table top. At first I thought it should be a round top, but we settled on square because it is easier to build and gives a little more surface area.

![Table Top Sketch](images/table-top-drawing.png)

![Unpainted Table Top](images/table-top.jpeg)

## Duolingo

Today is Sunday. I am starting the lessons **Shopping 5** and **Health 2** on Duolingo. Duolingo shows that I have learned 2932 words in Spanish. Recall that my goal is 10,000 words to be fluent. I started on May 21, 2019 which means I have been learning Spanish for 1 year, 6 months, and 8 days which is 558 days not including today.

Let's do a simple extrapolation to get to the day when I will know 10,000 words:

$$D_{10,000} = \dfrac{10,000}{2932}558 = 1,903\text{ days}$$

The remaining days to get to 10,000 then would be 1,903 - 558 = 1,345 days which puts estimated completion at August 5, 2024.

## Sobriety Day 3

We are still going strong on our quest not to drink alcohol anymore. Julie is really down right now. She is not talking much, either, which worries me. She decided to watch the last season of [_The Handmaid's Tale_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)), because she had started it, and it just became available to watch inexpensively. But the story itself is depressing, and she keeps seeing ads in between that are depressing -- reminders of COVID-19 and how sucky the world is right now. I would rather she do something wholesome like play music online, but we shall see. Hopefully she will regain her energy later this afternoon and play music.

## Tommy is Flunking

Tommy is flunking almost every class right now except guitar. He is getting an 80% in guitar which is a low B.

## 2020-11-30 Julie's Back

I was on a conference call today around 3:15 pm when Tommy knocked and told me, "Mom is on the floor and can't get up." It took a good 10 seconds before it sunk in what he was telling me. I dropped off my conference call and went to the kitchen to find Julie laying flat on the floor with what we think are back spasms. She was reaching out across the table for something, and she had a sharp pain that made her go to the floor.

We soon got her to her feet, but she could not get comfortable either standing or sitting. I took some wood I had and made her a pallet with some cushions from the garage, all on top of the bed. She is there now as I am typing this, watching her friend Jen Porter play piano on Twitch. She seems to be doing OK for now.

## Ontologies

Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_components>

An ontology is a system of definitions and interrelations that describe a "domain of discourse." 

> ...an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.

Almost universal components of ontologies:

- **Individuals**: The basic, ground level objects.

- **Classes**: Sets, collections, concepts, types of objects, or kinds of things

- **Attributes**: Aspects, properties, features, characteristics, or parameters that objects and classes can have.

- **Relations**: Ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another.

Less common components include:

- **Function terms**: Complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement 

- **Restrictions**: Formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input

- **Rules**: Statements in the form of an if-then (antecedent-consequent) sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form

- **Axioms**: Assertions (including rules) in a logical form that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application. This definition differs from that of "axioms" in generative grammar and formal logic. In those disciplines, axioms include only statements asserted as a priori knowledge. As used here, "axioms" also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements

- **Events**: The changing of attributes or relations

## PDF Studio Pro Upgrade

Today I upgraded my Qoppa PDF Studio Pro license to the 2020 version because it was on sale 50% off. Each year they seem to have a sale at the end of the year. I'm sure they are about to roll out the 2021 version, but I'm perfectly content having the preceeding year's version at half the cost!

## 2020-12-02

I went to Big Bend today to get my SafeStart module 2 book. I ended up spending the whole day there. Chris Steele called me into his office at 2:00 pm to discuss strategy for the department. It was exciting to see me considered a leader. I was filled with pride over it. When I got home, I told Julie that I received a lot of positive feedback today. I don't normally talk much about work to her, but I told her the news that Chris was wanting to treat me as a peer and assign half of his team to report to me. She said something to the effect, "You are getting screwed over for taking on Chris' team for no more money." I was crestfallen. I uttered something like, "Why did you make it so negative?" Then I realized this was just Julie. I decided to just shut up about it and move on. She noticed the change and realized it was hurtful of her to shit on my good news. She said something like, "If I had this conversation to do over again, I would have simply said, 'Good for you!'" It was good to see her be self-aware, but it still stung. The damage was done. It made me not want to share good news with her in the future. She will probably just find the cloud in the silver lining.

But this is ill-will toward her. It's not right. I will try meditating on it tonight to see if I can get over with it. Maybe I will try a loving kindness meditation.

## Django Installation

Today I installed Django using [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django). Here were my settings:

```bash

```

After that I installed PostgreSQL 12 using the command:

```bash
$ brew install postgresql@12
```

I used version 12 because Cookiecutter Django does not prompt for version 13.

I also had to add this to `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/bin:$PATH"
```

This gave me some weird error, so I uninstalled it and instead installed `Postgres.app` from this website: <https://postgresapp.com/>. This seemed to work.

## 2020-12-09 Systems Thinking

A system is an entity made up of interrelated, interdependent parts that acts in a purposive way. It exists in an environment with other system. Its top-level parts are subsystems. Each subsystem is a complete system in its own right. The subsystem's environment is the parent system.

Each person in the organization is not part of the organization's system. It is not even an input, but its service is. It's more like a tool. A person is its own complete (and very complex I might add) system. It is a service provider. Services include sensing things, thinking, and physical labor. We should treat each employee like a contractor: define the work to be done and the minimum expectations. They _how_ is more flexible. The individual can contribute ways to do things, improvise, etc.

A job description should have the same parts as a Construction Scope of Work.

The OPM department is providing information to its environment. It takes labor, money, raw materials, and information as inputs and outputs information, constructed materials, and money. 

The labor is the engine that converts the information into money. Or by thinking instead, the labor force uses the money to get contractors to provide some of the information we are selling. Labor is the energy input. Money is a store of labor, so it is a store of energy input. It is a battery. We can take batteries from outside systems in exchange for something of value: raw materials, information, or even more money, uh, batteries if it is invested.

Each of us individual workers is our own system, and like the company, we need to profit to get along. We provide our labor (body) and thinking (mind) in exchange for money. The money is a store of labor we can now save, invest, or deploy. So if we need a gallon of gas, we exchange some of the money we earned for the labor and thought it took to extract, refine, ship, and dispense gasoline.

A person can provide either information processing (brain power) or physical labor (body power). Each one costs the person precious time and energy. The brain does for the company what it does best: it processes information, solves problems, communicates, decides,  

## Types of Waste in Service Industry

1. Delay on the part of customers waiting for service, for delivery, in queues for response, not arriving as promised.

1. Duplication. Having to re-enter data, repeat details on forms, copy 
information across, answer queries from several sources within the same 
organisation.

1. Unnecessary Movement. Queuing several times, lack of one-stop, poor 
ergonomics in the service encounter.

1. Unclear communication, and the wastes of seeking clarification, confusion 
over product or service use, wasting time finding a location that may result 
in misuse or duplication.

1. Incorrect inventory. Being out-of-stock, unable to get exactly what was required, substitute products or services.

1. An opportunity lost to retain or win customers, a failure to establish 
rapport, ignoring customers, unfriendliness, and rudeness.

1. Errors in the service transaction, product defects in the product-service 
bundle, lost or damaged goods.

1. Service quality errors, lack of quality in service processes.

Typical contracts for a project.

- Design Criteria Agreement
- Site Investigation Agreement
- Design Agreement
- Purchase Agreement
- Construction Agreement

## 2020-12-19

I've been studying the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) for a few days. Based upon this, I now see a project as an occurrent. A process is an occurrent, too. Normally I think of a process as a kind of black box that converts inputs into outputs. That may be a useful way to conceptualize a process. But it can also be considered an occurrent. It is a period of time during which a number of individual tasks are done and decisions made that produce outputs and outcomes (side-effects). # 2020-12-25 Christmas Shingles

Today was Christmas Day. I have not had an alcoholic beverage since Thanksgiving, making this Day 34. We are going strong with no sign of letting up.

I noticed a rash forming on my forehead today. Tracing it around, I found it also appearing on my scalp. Julie got concerned and checked with our nurse friend Karen Howard, and Karen recommended I get checked out immediately. She was afraid it was shingles. She knows that untreated shingles can cause some nasty side effects like blindness as it attacks the optic nerve. So I signed back up for Teledoc with Blue Cross Blue Shield and got diagnosed with shingles. They prescribed an ant-viral medicine.

## 2020-12-27

In thinking about an ontology, what is a task? 

- A period of time during which you are performing goal-oriented work.
- A string of words on one line of a task list.
- A recurring job to do.

For my ontology I am thinking something like this:

Task
: The idea of doing work to accomplish a goal.

Project
: A planned process composed using a sequence of tasks.

Backlog
: The list of outstanding tasks at any given time.

Project List
: A database of projects.

Project List Implementation
: The physical way the project list is recorded in the real world. It could be a whteboard, a paper list, a spreadsheet, or a SharePoint library.

## 2020-12-30 My Business

I just learned that the word business essentially means any activity that you do to make a profit. So I guess my "business" includes working at TECO and investing. Formerly I could have included playing band gigs.

Today I worked for about a half day, reporting to Big Bend because of an outage. The outage ended last night, so it turned out I did not really need to be there. But I worked anyway.

Julie made some non-alcoholic mimosas. They are really pretty good. I sat in the living room and listened to Tommy for maybe 30 minutes before about 9:00 pm. Joey was on his computer all night like usual. He does not tend to interact unless he wants something.

## OKRs for 2021

I suddenly decided to try out OKRs for the first time. I will be replacing my Habitica habit with OKRs. So I created a Google Sheets document to track the OKRs and here we go.

![OKRs for 2021](images/okr-start-2021.png)

## Retrospective

My Anki usage has skyrocketed this year. I am addicted to it, but I think it is a good addiction. Here were my results today -- compare with the results back on [2020-05-22]!

![Anki Results on December 31, 2020](images/anki-end-of-2020.png)

[Anki Stats on December 31, 2020](images/anki-stats-2020-12-31.pdf)

I used [Habitica](https://habitica.com) all year long. My best habits in 2020 include:

- Brush teeth in the morning.
- Take meds (also in the morning).
- Apply Scalpicin to ears.
- Brush teeth before bed.
- Shine the sink.
- Shine both toilets.
- Study Duolingo.
- Study Anki cards.
- Floss.
- Dry brush teeth. (This was a good year for my teeth)

Habtis I fell short on:

- Clean the house for 1 hour each Sunday.
- Review Outlook tasks.
- Review tasks.microsoft.com (discontinuing now).

What do I take pride in personally speaking?

1. Being the smartest person in the room.
1. Being a musician. In 2020 I was _not_ a musician.
1. Being a good father. In 2020 I was hit and miss with this one. I did a lot with Joey: working out and driving. I did not spend enough time with Tommy.
1. Being a good husband. I think I was a pretty good husband in 2020. Not sure what else she can expect from me.
1. Being a better son. This one still needs work. I kept in touch with both parents, but they will not be around forever, and I want to be kinder to my mom.
1. Staying in better mental and physical shape than most men my age. This one was mixed. I did work out with Joey quite a lot, and I can see some results in my body. I did not do enough aerobic exercise for my comfort level, and I did not meditate nearly enough. These are things to work on in 2021.

## 2021-01-04 Deliberative Problem-Solving Method

1. State, or "frame," the problem to be solved;
2. Identify and prioritize the relevant values, interests, and objectives;
3. Identify and resolve major uncertainties concerning the cause of the problem;
4. Generate a range of plausible solutions or alternative courses of action;
5. Predict the consequences of the courses of action and assess their impact on the relevant interests or objectives;
6. Select the course of action that optimizes the interests or objectives to be served (i.e., make a decision);
7. Implement, observe, and learn from the outcome of the decision.

## Building an Ontology using Protege

1. Add classes. Accept disjoint relationship default.
1. Remove unnecessary disjoint relationships.
1. Add object properties. Accept default: _not_ disjoint.
1. Give each object property a type: functional, inverse functional, symmetric, asymmetric, transitive, reflexive, and irreflexive.
1. Add individuals under the Individuals task.
1. Assign a Type to each individual.

## 2021-01-10 Mom's Birthday

Today is my mom's birthday. She is 79 years old. We called her after lunch and had a nice chat. It was a longer call than we've had in the past. Julie and I talked from the hot tub. 

## Improving OPM

_What is the current situation that we intend to impact?_

The reputation for performance of OPM needs to be strengthened.

_What will it look like when we achieve the desired situation or outcome?_

Upper management will approve of the performance of the department.

_What behaviors need to change for that outcome to be achieved?_

We have to satisfy the customers: the station's management, director, and upper management. 

_What knowledge or skills do people need before the behavior will change?_


_What activities need to be performed to cause the necessary learning?_


_What resources will be required to achieve the desired outcome?_

This system diagram was proposed by Mihály Csikszentmihalyi in a book promoting a "systems approach" to creativity. But I can see other uses.

![System Diagram for Creativity](../diagrams/yed/individual-domain-field-system.png)

**Individual**
: A single person

**Discipline**
: A portion of reality studied by a field

**Field**
: The set of individuals practicing in the discipline

This is an interesting trio. Let's look at some examples from my life.

    - Individual = Bhikku
    - Discipline = Dharma
    - Field = Sangha
- Structural Engineering
    - Individual = Joe Legner

## 2021-01-18 Virtue Continuum

Julie sent this to me today, and I liked it.

![Virtue Continuum](images/virtue-continuum.jpg)

## 2021-01-23 Objectives and Decisions



Decisions are best understood as attempts by the decision maker to meet their objectives or goals. Assuming the decision maker wants their influence on the future to be _positive_ we might characterize their objectives as capturing their perceived idea of a better future.

Objectives represent desires that may be described by a verb and an object.

- `[Verb]` `[object]`
- Minimize effort
- Maximize safety
- Improve quality

The _set_ of objectives provides the _purpose_ for a decision, specifying what one hopes to achieve.

If this is all true, it follows that:

> Knowing one's objectives is essential to sound decision making.

## What ways were fruitful to get people to generate more objectives?

1. Providing decision makers with a category-based aid was of limited success.

1. Providing decision makers with a category-based aid to _supplement_ their original list resulted in improvement. The motivation to add more objectives or a second chance to think about objectives seems to be important.

1. Believing that additional effort (a second look) will be fruitful improved the ability to generate objectives. Informing people that research indicates most individuals can add more objectives resulted in substatial improvements.

1. Giving a target number of objectives was helpful. One way to do this is to make the simple request to list objectives, double the number they generated, and inform them that the new target is this doubled value, probably without telling them why you arrived at this number.


## What ways were not?

1. Providing sample objectives. The cause might be that exposure to certain items in a target set may inhibit recall of other items.# 2021-01-27 Estimating Probability of a Good Outcome

You have inputs, a decision-making process, the decision -- which is the output of the decision-making process, and the results, or outcome. Here are the steps you take. This is normally done informally.

1. Collect the facts. These are the inputs to the procedure.
2. Analyze the facts to make a decision. You use a procedure for this.
3. Observe the outcome of the decision.

How likely is it that what I believe to be true is really true? How good is my information? 

How likely is it that I used the right decision-making process?

How likely is it that I used the decision-making process right?

When I design a steel beam. Where are the possible sources of problems? The steel could be bad. The wrong shape could be used by the fabricator. The bolts might be defective. The loads might be higher than anticipated. There might be a calculation error. There might be an error in the code. 

We could take the inverse of these and multiply the lot of them, as long as they are independent. It would seem like a waste of time to bother estimating things with such a remote probability that it will not materially affect the coverall **conjunctive** event. The probability does not change much when you multiply it by a microprobability: (1 - 1/1000000) = 0.999999.

What about "ordinary" risks like equipment failures and design success? Here we are definitly within the realm of something out of 100 chance being acceptable. In honor of microprobability, suppose we call this a "centiprobability." It's truly a _percent_ chance.

We don't want equipment to fail regularly. So on an hourly basis, we might be in the microprobability order of magnitude. But the failure rate over, say, 10 years might be well into the centiprobability order of magnitude. We might say OK to a 45% chance in 10 years.

## 2021-04-01 Vaccine Dose 1

Today I got the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the greyhound track site, 755 E. Waters Avenue, Tampa, Florida. The experience was a good one. The military appears to be involved, and the organization of getting people in and out was outstanding. Julie went to the same place earlier today, and she had the same opinion as to the quality of the organizing.

## 2021-04-03 48th Birthday

Today is my birthday. I am 48 years old. I probably have another 30 years or so, which means I am more than halfway through my life. It has been a great life. I don't know that I always appreciated how great it has been. I've had a lot of unnecessary suffering in my life, because I did not know how to relate to it. It think now as I enter my 49th year, I am in a better state than ever with regards to accepting life and having purpose and direction.

I am currently waiting to interview for two manager positions at work. One of them is Manager of Engineering Support Services, affectionately known as the "MESS". This is the position that was vacated by my boss, Chris Steele, when he announced he was leaving the company to work for a utility called Liberty in New Hampshire. It is the logical extension of my career to date. The other position is Manager of Transmission Engineering, which is in the other business unit: Electric Delivery. I work in Energy Supply. The transmission engineering position suits me well, because I am a structural engineer, and the projects involve transmission structures. I think I would prefer the MESS, however, because I want to see through my story to its logical conclusion.

## 2021-04-15 Unease at Work

I am uneasy at work right now. I'm sort of in charge of the department, except that I am not technically the manager, so I do not have the positional power. People seem to be following me well enough, but the results are not there. I am worried that we are not on track for our spending for the year. I just want to see some evidence. That will no doubt raise my spirits. So far the only data I have is a graph that shows we are behind.

I wonder why I have this unease. I guess it means I wish things were other than they are. I do wish that. But things can only be like they are. Why fight it? The best we can do is shape the future. I would like to say it is uncertainty that is behind the unease. But intellectually, I know everything is uncertain, so my prediction of the future is uncertain, and it should not make me feel bad. I am probably also fearing future censure from people who like me or look up to me. I fear dire consequences happening to the department or me.

I just had a fantasy about a meeting where I'm reading results to the department like a televangelist, and the team is hooting like some kind of locker room pep talk. I'm talking about how many projects they did, how many miles of cable they installed, and stuff like that.

## My Standards For Myself

I want to weigh 165 +/- 5 pounds. I feel healthier, sexier, and more accomplished if I put on a little muscle. It's worth the effort.

I want to be a lifelong learner.

I want to be able to change my own mind about things.

I want to learn new things.

I want to be a kind person that respects people.

I do not want to be a wimp. I want to be ready to fight for something important to me.

I want the things that are important to me to be wholesome.# 2021-04-20

Tomorrow I am interviewing for the Manager of Engineering Support Services (MESS, ironically) for the Outages and Project Management Department (O&PM) of the Energy Supply business unit of Tampa Electric Company. I'm not sure why I wrote all that, but I guess deep down I hope someone who does not know me might read this. Maybe.

Anyway, one of the questions that they will ask at the end is basically, "Why do you think we should choose you?" It's meant to give them some time to finish their ratings. But I want to answer well. And here's the rub: I am not sure I want the job. It's a lot to take on. 

I came here to write my thoughts about answering that question, but I think I should analyze the anxiety I am feeling tonight. 

## Situation / Trigger

The activating event was a bad day at work where I learned that a bunch of schedules I had been expecting were not done and not only not done, but not even close.

## Feelings

By "feelings" I mean both bodily sensations and emotions. The only bodily sensation that I felt was sort of a malaise like when you did not get enough sleep.

Let's rate my feelings from zero (0) to one hundred (100) with 0 meaning "I did not experience this at all" and 100 meaning, "I cannot imagine experiencing this any stronger than I did."

- Anxious about the outcome (40)

- Worried about not sleeping tonight (50)

- Remorseful (for applying to the position) (25)

- Overwhelmed (80)

- Worn out (70)

- Unready (50)

- Unsure what to do (40)

## Unhelpful Thoughts / Images

- Jack is going to see that I am not competent to lead this team.

- The department is going to fail in its mission and get disbanded. It didn't help that one of the other managers almost said the same thing of his own volition during a conversation at the end of the day.

- If I take this job, my stress level will go even higher, and what's the point of that?

- If I take this job, I will fail and be humiliated. If the department dissolves, I will forever be branded with that failure.

- There are not enough people in the department to do the work that needs to be done.

- I should not have applied to the position.

- There is no time to withdraw from the application. If I get the offer, I will not be able to turn it down without getting blacklisted from that point forward.

## Facts that support the unhelpful thought

- The manager told me today that Jack is a difficult boss. He said he is contemplating leaving the department.

- The department did not come through on building schedules it committed to completing by today.

- We seem to have fewer people now than in the past, and we were not that successful in the past.

- There have been many managers that came before me, and none of them fixed it.

## Facts that provide evidence against the unhelpful thought

- I talked to another manager who seemed more upbeat. He knows we face a tough climb, but he was less concerned that the first guy.

- I just got into this semi-managerial position, and they cannot expect me to turn around the performance of the department on a dime without any real authority.

- I am new to leadership at this level, and those judging me know it.

- The people who judge me have also had failures in life. They value consistent effort toward the objectives.

- We have had years in the past where everyone was worried about spending, but the department ended up delivering, more or less.

- We have some really good people, and we are able to engage resources to help them. We just have to explain why.

- I have a far above-average intelligence.

- I have never failed to impress when doing my job, except with Tom Berry.

## Alternative, more realistic and balanced perspective

- There is a good chance I will get offered a position in Electric Delivery anyway, and there is no shame in going over there instead.

- Management probably expects less of me than I do of myself.

- I am learning how to cope with stress better and better lately, using mindfulness, exercise, and time outdoors.

- It's not only on me to make the department work. It has to be the team. And the team seems to respect me and trust me. I think they will follow me, for the most part.

- My analytic mind might come up with some good ideas, like some basic metrics people can understand and gel under.

- Even the worst-case scenario is not really anything in the big picture. In fact, a big life change might actually turn out to be a blessing.

- Being a manager is not going to change my personality, and I am pretty well-liked around the company right now. I will probably continue to be liked even if I don't meet my own expectations.

- I might make a positive impact on people's lives. THey will be working for a caring person who thinks right action is about kindness, respect, truthfulness, timeliness, and wisdom.

- I might turn out to be great at leading people.

Let's re-rate the feelings now. My somatic response is normal right now. I don't sense any real tension apart from normal life.

- Anxious about the outcome (20)

- Worried about not sleeping tonight (40)

- Remorseful (for applying to the position) (0)

- Overwhelmed (50)

- Worn out (I won't re-rate, because now it's late, and I'm physically worn out)

- Unready (50)

- Unsure what to do (20)

## 2021-04-22 Today was Wholesome

Today was a wholesome day. I did not sleep well, but it was enough to sustain my energy all day. The weather was glorious: cool, clear, and calm. 

I studied the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People when I got home and now finally understand Habit 3: Put First Things First and Habit 6: Synergize. I also noticed that some of the habits are eerily similar to both Buddhist philosophy and Cognitive Behavior Theory. Habit 3 is about prioritizing what is important over what is not important. So I got to thinking, "What is something important that I have put off regularly?" I remembered that I have not been meditating much, but I simultaneously feel sure that meditating is important to my well-being. So I formed an aspiration to meditate first thing every day, and I added an Anki card to remind me. I will do a 10-minute meditation in the morning.

I went for a walk tonight and was very mindful. Julie was gone at her friend's house on the porch. I walked without wearing headphones or any other distraction. And I suddenly started noticing the six sense doors. I saw a bird, recognized it as a bird, and noted my faculty of perception in action. I noted seeing as "seeing." I noticed smells -- that's unusual for me. Normally when I walk, I  only notice a smell if it demands attention. Tonight I noticed smells almost continuously. I noticed the air kind of has its own smell. I was mindful of hearing and seeing. I even breathed through my mouth for a bit and could sort of taste the air. I felt a few bodily sensations, like my lower jaw bouncing due to gravity. I did a one-pointed meditation on my left knee, for no particular reason, and felt the wind on all sides of it while at the same time experiencing the sensation of it flexing and bouncing. I saw a bat, felt a glad feeling arise, and noticed that a glad feeling had arisen. And I even was mindful of wisdom, thinking to myself what a priveledge it has been to be alive but fully aware that it will end some day and perfectly OK with that. 

I think this is the feeling of freedom or zen or whatever you want to say. I know it won't last. But maybe it will arise again. Maybe experiencing it sometimes strengthens the mind's capacity to get there. Perhaps. At any rate, I am grateful it happened tonight.

## 2021-04-29

I haven't felt a strong pull to write a journal entry lately. But ironically, when I had to do those surveys (that I never told you about until just now) every night, it was enjoyable to do. I really think I could create my own set of a few and take them every day to do some experimenting. I could model the behavior I want (right view or something) and add a measurement. It can be something real, like the number of times that day that I did $X$. Or it can be more abstract, like my subjective self-confidence rating.

If you could do this and also record everything you _do_ in a day, you could start to find correlations. Maybe whenever you talk to a friend, you are happy for two days thereafter. Then you can say, "Hey, I should go play music with Nichole. It's wholesome. It will help me, and it will help her."

OK, so let's think what a good behavior might be. It seems like it should be something social. My self-care behaviors are pretty good right now. Let's start with some communications ideas. How about these?

- Text a friend.
- Text a parent.
- See a friend in person.
- Coach someone.
- Encourage someone.
- Complement someone.
- Give positive feedback about someone.
- Talk up the vision.
- Write something.
- Read something.
- Meditate.

## Department System

I feel like the department is the people only. The department _has_ a budget. The department _has_ facilities it uses. But the department is not these things. It is the people only. They are the only actors. They are purposeful elements of the system. If I ever want to diagram the department system, it would simply be the people. In fact, I could use the organization chart. The relationship in the hierarchy would be something like, "reports to" and "directs" in the other direction.

## 2021-05-29 Domain Ontology Ideas

I want to write an ontology, or maybe a better word is knowledgebase, which is an ontology plus the individuals that belong to the domain. 

## KB

For years I've had this "KB" project which is essentially a set of PDFs. What if I made this into a formal ontology? Individuals would include the PDFs, and any other medium of knowledge capture and retrieval, such as physical books, audio recordings, and videos.

## Buddhist Path

This idea would be to create an ontology to model the concepts of the Buddhist path. This would include terms like Buddha, dharma, Noble Eightfold Path, Four Noble Truths, and so on.


## Music

This ontology idea is to capture my musical life: bands, gigs, performances, instruments, practice, etc. It would answer the question, "How can I best actualize my musician identity?"

## My Life

This would be much more ambitious than the ideas above. This ontology would answer big questions like:

1. What is the best way to spend my time?
1. How much exercise do I need?
1. What should I eat and drink?
1. What are my values?
1. How do I best pursue my values?
1. What actions are wholesome?
1. Are habits better than goals and OKRs?
1. How do I build habits?
1. How do I achieve enlightenment?

It could even be the culimination of several smaller ontologies rolled into one. How about something like:

- My Musical Life
- My Inner Life
- My Personal Life
- My Spiritual Life
- My Work Life
- My Social Life

Or it could be self-actualization type ontologies, each one named after an identiy I want to cultivate.

- Social Person
    - Husband
    - Friend
- Engineer
- Musician
- Lifelong Learner
- Teacher

Here are some terms and ideas.

- A person spends time on an activity.
- An activity is when we employ our body and mind to do something.
- A person has things they value in life.
- An objective is a short-term state of affairs derived from values and circumstances.
- Wellness includes physical health and mental health.
- Wholesome is an adjective meaning "conducive to or indicative of good health or well-being."
- A habit is an activity you regularly engage in without having to summon up motivation.

Wholesome activities is the set of activities conducive to desired states of physical health, mental health, social status, 


## The Eight Worldly Conditions

1. Gain 
1. Loss
1. Praise 
1. Blame
1. Good Reputation 
1. Bad Reputation
1. Pleasure 
1. Pain

We can use these to help us define wholesome and unwholesome activities.

- A wholesome activity leads away from loss, blame, bad reputation, and pain.
- A wholesome activity leads toward gain, praise, good reputation, and pleasure.
- An un wholesome activity leads toward from loss, blame, bad reputation, and - pain.
- An unwholesome activity leads away from gain, praise, good reputation, and pleasure.

The law of karma is what connects wholesome actions to positive outsomes.

- Being - Existing without doing or training.
- Training - Getting better at doing something.
- Doing - Performing what we have trained to do.
- Reflecting - Thinking about all the above.

## 2021-05-30 JoeKB Ontology

I am going to make my ontology the JoeKB Ontology. It think it will be a good starting point. 

## Domain and Scope

The domain for this ontology includes the following portions of the world:
- Things owned by Joe Legner.
- Things that are computer files of books or book-like works.
- Things that are physical books.

The scope should include the content, categorization, tagging, search, and retrieval of said things, including the physical books. Retrieval of the physical books will require some kind of notions of location in the real world. We might start with address, building, room, and location within room as a basic system.

It should be able to handle the same computer file in multiple locations.

It sould be able to handle:
- Multiple copies of the same computer file.
- Multiple copies of the same work in physical book format and computer file format.

It will probably need to be populated programatically somehow, by looking at Metadata in PDF files or looking up book metadata online using ISBN or something.

## Competency Questions

1. What PDF files do I have related to engineering?
1. What PDF files do I have related to structural engineering?
1. What PDF files do I have related to structural steel engineering?
1. Where should new information go?

## SQLite and Python

I have this vague idea that I should get really good at using SQLite and Python together. I have looked at things like SQLAlchemy, and other things like Django ORM, but none of them really do exactly what I want them to do. That gives me this harebrained idea of writing my own library. But I don't think I want to commit to something like that. But just for fun, what if I brainstorm what it might look like if it was being used and worked well?

It should be dead simple to connect to the database.

```python
>>> from xxx import Database
>>> db = Database("opm.sqlite3")
>>> db.tables()
["deliverable", "deliverable_process", "process", "process_deliverable"]
```

A record should be its own class of the same name, but capitalized.

```python
>>> for record in db["deliverable"]:
...     print(type(record))
Deliverable
```
We could do this with the database so it always closes.

```python
>>> with Database("opm.sqlite3") as db:
...      pass
```

The other class in many-to-many relations should be easy to access.

```python
>>> deliverable = db["deliverable"][0]   # Returns first record
>>> print(deliverable)
"Support Request"
>>> print(deliverable.processes)
(("Onboarding Process", 0),}
```

Note how the processes are returned as a tuple of tuples. This is because each many-to-many table (here `deliverable_process`) can add data. So we need more than just the other instance of Process. We need the data, too, and we can provide it in the tuple.

```python
with Database("opm.sqlite3") as db:
    with db["deliverable"] as table:
        for record in table:
            print(record)
```

What would it look like in a Jinja2 scenario?

```python
db = Database("opm.sqlite3"),
context = {
    "deliverables"  : db["deliverable"],
    "processes"     : db["process"],
    "roles"         : db["roles"],
}
```

``` markdown
# Note, this is Markdown syntax.

{% for d in deliverables %}
# {{ d.name }}

{% if d.deliverable_process %}
Deliverable {{d.name}} is an input to these processes:
{% for process in d.deliverable_process %}
- {{process.name}} {% if d.is_trigger(process) %}(trigger){% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if d.process_deliverable %}
Deliverable {{d.name}} is output from these processes:
{% for process in d.deliverable_process %}
- {{process.name}}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if d.role_deliverable %}
These roles are involved in the production of deliverable {{d.name}}:
{% for role in d.role_deliverable %}
{{role.name}} is {{role.role_deliverable.raci_name}} for {{d.name}}
{% endfor %}

## Old Journal Entries

I went back today and read some old journal entries from about a year ago, and I have to say, I loved it! I have slacked off writing here recently, at least since the first of the year. I'm not sure why. I guess I thought it would not be helpful to keep typing things I would never really ready anyway. But maybe I will. I got some good nuggets today going back and re-reading. I think it would be a good idea to set aside a few hours and do nothing but review this journal, adding Anki cards and questions to my Apple Reminders list. I use it for tracking questions to look up or ponder later.

![Questions Reminders App](images/questions-reminders-list.png)

## Workout

Today I worked out. Yesterday I decided I'd been too unmotivated to work out, so I changed things up. I made each workout only 2 or 3 exercises. That way I hope I will feel up to working out more regularly. It really helps my self-esteem and maybe even my body!

## Anki Today

Today my Anki system is pretty solid.

## Virgin Islands Job

I *may* have applied to a job as director of engineering for the Virgin Islands Port Authority. I'm probably a long-shot candidate, but hey.

## Fact

1. Incident, act, event, or circumstance. A fact is something that has already been done or an action in process. It is an event that has definitely and actually taken place, and is distinguishable from a suspicion, innuendo, or supposition. A fact is a truth as opposed to fiction or mistake. A Question of Fact in litigation is concerned with what actually took place. During a trial, questions of fact are generally left for the jury to determine after each opposing side has presented its case. By contrast, a Question of Law is ordinarily decided by a judge, who must deal with applicable legal rules and principles that affect what transpired.

1. An actual thing or happening, which must be proved at trial by presentation of evidence and which is evaluated by the finder of fact (a jury in a jury trial, or by the judge if he/she sits without a jury).

1. An event, occurrence or state of affairs known to have happened; to be distinguished from opinion or law. Facts can however be found proven in legal proceedings where they may or may not have actually happened. Facts may also be inferred from other facts.

1. Something that has actual existence : a matter of objective reality

1. Any of the circumstances of a case that exist or are alleged to exist in reality : a thing whose actual occurrence or existence is to be determined by the evidence presented at trial.

FACT. An action; a thing done. It is either simple or compound.

2. A fact is simple when it expresses a purely material act unconnected with any moral qualification; for example, to say Peter went into his house, is to express a simple fact. A compound fact contains the materiality of the act, and the qualification which that act has in its connexion with morals and, the law. To say, then, that Peter has stolen a horse, is to express a compound fact; for the fact of stealing, expresses at the same time, the material fact of taking the horse, and of taking him with the guilty intention of depriving the owner of his property and appropriating it to his own use; which is a violation of the law of property.

3. Fact. is also put in opposition to law; in every case which has to be tried there are facts to be established, and the law which bears on those facts.

4. Facts are also to be considered as material or immaterial. Material facts are those which are essential to the right of action or defence, and therefore of the substance of the one or the other - these must always be proved; or immaterial, which are those not essential to the cause of action these need not be proved. 3 Bouv. Inst. n. 3150-53.

5. Facts are generally determined by a jury,; but there are many facts, which, not being the principal matters in issue, may be decided by the court; such, for example, whether a subpoena has or has not been served; whether a party has or has not been summoned, &c. As to pleading material facts, see Gould. Pl. c. 3, s. 28. As to quality of facts proved, see 3 Bouv. Inst. n. 3150. Vide Eng. Ece. R. 401-2, and the article Circumstances.# 2021-06-30 Hard Rain

Today around 3:00 or 3:30 it rained, hard, at Big Bend Station. The ditches were all running. The parking lot was so flooded that the water went over top of my shoes as I got in my car to go home.

In related weather news, the hurricane season is just now starting to get going. There are some disturbances in the Cape Verde pattern that they are watching.

## Rentz's Closed

I learned today that Rentz's Tap in Odell closed. # 2021-07-04 Decisions

Here are a few terms and relations between terms to whet one's appetite for learning about decision-making. The first block quotes are taken from "An Overview of Decision Theory."

> **Decision theory** deals with **situations** in which one or more **actors** must make **choices** among given **alternatives**. These alternatives may be courses of action to be undertaken, objects to possess, amounts of money to pay for them, etc. They mayaiso be 'what to believe'. For instance, a jury deliberating on the guilt or innocence of a defendant must eventually choose collectively between 'believing that the defendant is guilty' and 'believing that he is innocent'.

> **Choice** and **freedom of choice** are primitive (not further analyzable) terms and the assumption that such freedom exists is fundamental in decision theory.

> Furthermore, decision theory is based on an assumption that each choice (decision) entails consequences called **outcomes** and that each of the actors making the decisions has **preferences** for the different outcomes. It is not assumed that an actor necessarily has full **knowledge** of just what those consequences will be; but it is assumed that an actor envisages at least some of them, and it is these envisaged consequences that he prefers to varying degrees. The extent and the precision of an actor's knowledge (or presumed knowledge) of the consequences is specified in a particular model of a **decision situation**.

Consequences may involve **gains** or **losses**.

> In order to discuss a **decision situation** with the view of understanding it better, the situation must be circumscribed. Specification of what is to be assumed or taken into account amounts to formulating a **model**. Decision theory, like any other theory, considers **models of situations** rather than situations in all their complexities and ramifications.

> A **descriptive decision theory** purports to deal with questions pertaining to how people behave in given choice situations. It raises questions about what we need to know in order successfully to predict their behaviour in such situations. A **normative theory** poses questions of a different sort, namely, how people *ought to* behave in given decision situations; also how the individual preferences of the actors can be reconciled with their collective interests (if any).

> The branch of normative decision theory dealing with situations involving more than one actor constitutes the **theory of games**. the distinction between games involving exactly two actors, now called **players** (two-person games) and those involving more than two ($n$-person games) is an important one, because $n$-person games may involve the formation of **coalitions**.

> The possibility of forming coalitions is the essential feature of the **cooperative game**. Members of coalition **cooperate** in the sense that they coordinate their strategies while they pursue a **common goal**. This cooperation makes sense only ifthe members of a coalition have a **common goal**. This is the case if they are able to achieve more by coordinating their choices than by playing independently. It is assumed in the theory of the cooperative game that the **coordination of choices** is achieved by effecting **agreements** and that these agreements are **enforceable**. The competitive aspect of an n-person cooperative game ($n > 2$) is manifested in the opposition between the interests of one coalition and those of other coalitions. At times, all of the $n$ players may form the **grand coalition**.

> The bargaining power of a player can be manifested in two ways: (1) by his **threat leverage** and (2) by his **value** to the particular coalitions he can join.

Thus a player can either be a threat or an ally. Doesn't this ring true in real life, especially work life with all its political machinations?

> The player can demand a larger share of \[the\] joint gain by threatemng to withdraw cooperation, that is, to ehoose some alternative other than that preseribed to hirn, resulting in a loss to others (as weIl as, generally, to hirnself). The relative threat leverage of the players is measured by the **losses entailed**. Games in whieh the threat leverages of the players are of central interest are called **bargaining games**.

> The **value** of a player to a **coalition** is reflected in the extent to which he can by joining it **increase the payoff** the coalition can expect to get if it has to play against the remaining players, also in coalition. In particular, in making a claim for a share of the joint payoff of the grand coalition, the player can bolster his claim by pointing out what he could gain if he (and perhaps some others) **broke away** from the grand coalition to form one of their own.

## Leah

Leah came to Julie's gig tonight! It was a fun surprise to see her. I was sitting at a table with Tiffanie and her friends, and there was Leah coming around the corner. She ended up coming over to the house after the show and left super late like 3:15 am. 

## 2021-07-07 Hurricane Elsa

[A hurricane named Elsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Elsa) went by in the Gulf in the early morning hours. It blew off one of our already-broken downspouts at the back porch, and we had one limb lying on the ground in the morning. It was a big nothing.

## Bo Burnham Special

We watched a new Bo Burnham special last night. That guy is crazy. He is a genius. The show is called [_Inside_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Burnham:_Inside), and he wrote, directed, filmed, and edited it, and the thing is masterful. # 2021-07-08 Mindfulness Experiment

Today on my way home, I did a spontaneous and unplanned mindfulness experiement. Recently, I have been listening to Joseph Goldstein talk about using passive voice for mental noting. That must have influenced me to perform this little mental experiment while I was driving.

Recently, I have been listening to Joseph Goldstein talk about using passive voice for mental noting. That must have influenced me to perform this little mental experiment while I was driving.

On the way home, I began mentally noting what was happening in a passive voice. They seem to have a calming influence on me. The last few days, I have felt a little unsettled about the world. I've had that kind of vague, "something is not right" feeling in my gut. Doing this thought experiment kind of made that fade for a while. Here are some examples of the phrases I said out loud quietly to myself:

- "Feeling acceleration, pressure increase."

- "Recognizing sign, words, license plate."

- "Recognizing red lights. Remembering brake lights. Thinking of risk."

- "Seeing mailbox and knowing of the seeing."

- "Pedal vibrating and knowing of vibrating."

- "Sloth and torpor."

- "Sensation; itching in eyebrow. Urge to scratch. Allowing scratching to occur. Scratching. Feeling of urge fading."

I went on and on. It was great fun, and my thoughts turned toward Julie and the kids. Maybe they can try it with me someday.

> Noticing "I" was used ten times here!

## 2021-07-11 Learning Cycle

Maybe I should think about how I learn. I'm talking about "book learning" here. What am I trying to do when I learn? Is it not the following?

1. Acquire idea about a known domain.

1. Acquire a new domain to explore.

1. Make a new connection between two concepts in an existing domain.

We can integrate this into my existing ontology knowledge. Remember that things naturally fall into:

1. Individuals

1. Classes

1. Relations

Now look at these two lists. They line up perfectly. If an "idea" is an individual, a "domain" is a class, and a "connection" is a relation, we see the similarity.

How do I spend my time when I'm trying to learn? Sometimes I read something, deeply. I take the time to study it and integrate the knowledge into my system as I go, painstakingly. I see this as increasing the depth of my knowledge. Other times I just wander. I might look up books by subject, browse weird WikiPedia sites, skim existing PDFs I have, or whatever. And often I find something this way. But when I find something, it's usually a shallower understanding. This is more like expanding the scope of my knowledge without increasing the depth. The third thing you might say I do is reflect, that is to ponder what I know now without going out to read what others have written. This seems to strengthen the connections between existing ideas I know about. This journal entry is a good example. I was sitting out in the backyard in a chair, when I felt urged to come and start writing this. I felt an urge to explore _how_ I, Joe Legner, personally acquire knowledge. And darn it if there was not immediately an interesting metaphor between my learning styles and ontologies. I made a connection between two domains today.

In fact, the concept of a metaphor seems important. What if our brain is a network of neurons that get strengthened from use. They like making connections between patterns. They see a pattern in the environment which triggers ideas in the mind. That set of ideas brought out by the environment might also be recognized as a pattern of its own, causing other ideas in the network to light up. Connections get strengthened by using them when thinking.

What about these three dimensions of knowledge?

- **Breadth** - How many domains I can talk about with some authority.

- **Depth** - How deep the authority goes in each domain.

- **Strength** - How effortless is the knowledge to access. How good am I at retrieving it.

What does a domain seem to include?

- That set of concepts currently held in the brains of individuals working in the field.

- Representations of all the domain's concepts in the form of representational artifacts: books, journal articles, video recordings, audio recordings, and other written and graphical artifacts of all kinds that can be used as representations of ideas.

- A social network which includes the was for individuals in the field to talk to each other and produce, store, maintain, and find the representational artifacts that record the domain's stored knowledge.

This is probably an appropriate time to go poke around in the world of cognitive science. The CRUM or Computational-Representational Understanding of the Mind seems like it has the potential to collect all these ideas into a single domain: a domain where mind and science intersect.

## 2021-07-20

Today our AAA Motor Club cards came in the mail. We ate Thai food from a new place in Brandon called Thai Chili Pepper. I got a yellow curry dish and the cucumber salad thing. We also shared lettuce wraps which were a big, big hit.

I've been reading the first part of a book called _The Stress Management Handbook_, by Eva Selhub, M.D. I did so much that I ordered one so I can read it to Joey. I think he would really benefit from it.

I was awfully disillusioned with studying Spanish, among other things. Today I felt a little more positive. I think it is when I get tired that I get down like that. I should notice when I'm sleepy and keep that in mind through the day so I don't do something stupid.

Anyway this book has a list of words that you can use to sort of examine your emotions at a particular point in time. I thought the list was pretty useful, so here it is.

![Word Choices to Examine Emotions at the Moment](images/word-choices.png)

Size in the book says to think of a time when you were angry, and then pick out words from the list. After that, divide them into positive and negative columns, ostensibly to see that the anger causes negative emotions to arise. In other words, the author expects you to have more words in the negative column then in the positive column. I did, when I did it in my head.

The author invites us to investigate our emotions deeply and look for both the root causes and the patterns that exist, historically. I guess the thing that really stands out is my desire not to be criticized. I get angry and defensive when somebody questions me on something that I am confident about. I don't like people to go against my recommendation, because I hold myself in such high esteem, that I think I could not possibly be wrong about it. _They_ are! It might be childhood memories of my mom and her sharp tongue. It came out a little bit while we were up in Illinois this past week. She just has a mean and hurtful side to her that is not very deeply hidden. It's ironic, because it's like there are two of her. One is this kindly grandma type, but underneath is this little hurtful bitch. Little hurtful bitch doesn't come out very often, thankfully. That's probably because I have adapted my behavior over the years. I have avoided these hurtful little bitch. In the past it was probably because I couldn't handle the pain. Now I think I am a little more wise and worldly maybe? Did things a little better now maybe? 

Why do I so dislike receiving criticism? It feels painful. I don't like others to disapprove of my performance. I want to be perfect, and I want people all to think I'm perfect.

## 2021-07-21 Types of Knowledge

I liked this list of the four types of knowledge from [army manual TP350-70-14](https://adminpubs.tradoc.army.mil/pamphlets/TP350-70-14.pdf).

The following are the four types of knowledge:

(a) Factual knowledge (terminology, specific details, and elements).

(b) Conceptual knowledge (classifications, categories, principles,generalizations, theories, models, and structures).

(c) Procedural knowledge (subject-specific skills and algorithms, subject-specific techniques and methods, and criteria for determining when to use appropriate procedures).

(d) Metacognitive knowledge (strategic knowledge, knowledge about cognitive tasks including appropriate contextual and conditional knowledge, and self-knowledge).


## 2021-07-22 Model-View-Controller (MVC)

This code snippet really makes the MVC concept clear to me.

```python
class Controller():

    def __init__(self):
        self.model = Model()                # create a new model
        self.view = View()                  # create a new view

    def handle(self, request):
        data = self.model.get_data(request) # get the data
        self.view.update(data)              # update the view
```

The controller seems to (1) own the model, (2) have a connection to the view, and (3) play the role of receiving and processing requests. It gets the data from the model, and then updates the view.

## Ladies Man Guitar Style Idea

Today I came up with this idea for Ladies Man:

1. Play fingerstyle.

1. When I pluck the bass note with my thumb, let it ring out.

1. But when I pluck the upper strings with my other three fingers, mute them like the Reggae Rocksteady rhythm.

I did this today with a Rihanna song and a a Sia song, and it seemed to work. I need to practice to make it smooth. I should record something and see if it sounds musical.

## 2021-07-24 Garage Door Opening Replacement

Our old garage door opener stopped working last week. It seems like it is stripped out.

I inspected it, and it looks like the trolley is stripped out. I ordered one from Amazon for $16.88, and it is supposed to arrive tomorrow. If this is successful, it will save me a few hundred dollars and probably three or four hours of my time.

## 2021-07-26 More Introspection

Today I thought of a couple things that lead me to think I might have an issue with abandonment. What triggered this idea was my recollection of Julie breaking up with me, either the first time or the second time. Both were traumatic for me. The first included the second blow of seeing her holding hands with another guy at the 4H park. That blow to the gut was a little consoled by the fact that she ran after me, stopped my car, and managed to make me feel special again. The other occassion that I think might contribute to my inner system of beliefs is my recollection of my parents' divorce. It felt like coldness. It felt like distance. It felt sad, like something had been lost. Something was missing. Something was being grieved.

I remember them giving me a book about the divorce not being my fault or something. The book reinforced the idea that each parent still loved the kid just as much as before; they had only stopped loving each other. It was a little hand-illustrated picture book. I remember them reading it a few times. I even remember requesting it, but doing so because I thought they wanted me to be interested in it. I'm not confident in that memory, but it might be true.

I don't remember fearing being abandoned by him. If anything, as sad and cruel as it sounds, I would have liked it better without him. I much preferred my mom's side of the family. I much preferred her house. I felt at home there. His place never felt right. It always felt alien. His family also felt alien. Or I felt alien with them. What's that called, then? What's this anti-abandonment feeling called? 

As I've matured, I've gotten much more compassionate feeling toward him. He was really a tortured soul, in many ways, and the divorce was a big part of it. I'm sure he felt terrible about himself after she rejected him. That had to have been quite a blow. But she had to do it. She was miserable. So I cannot blame her for anything, even something much more desperate than a divorce would be justified to reduce her unhappiness. I even think she might be somewhat mentally ill. I recently spent some time with her, and she is odd. I do not know another adult woman that is as neurotic as she is. It's no fucking wonder they were unhappy together. They are both miserable to begin with. He is not the reason she is miserable. She is not the reason he is miserable. They both have miserable souls. And on top of it, they are blind to their neuroses, and they instead blame each other for their unhappiness. They were both unhappy. He got married, because he loved her, and it made him happy. She got married, because she was too weak to get out of it. She felt like she failed right at the beginning, and she rejected him horribly on their wedding night, and at that moment, he knew he had failed. Neither of them could be happy after that. He has recounted that heartbreak moment several times to me as an adult, with plenty of wide-eyed, head-knodding notes of seriousness on his face.

If nothing else, the above is a fair representation of the stories each of them have woven about their experiences. That is the narrative, let's say.

I suddenly recalled a memory of me being very young and my parents telling me the words, "He won't be living here anymore." Like, I can almost hear my mother's voice. That would have been hard for them, and hard for little me. I remember they were both there. Now that I am older than they were, they seem like kids. I feel bad for them. They did their best. I don't blame them.

I can almost picture myself at the end of the oval table we had, farthest away from the kitchen window, sitting in a high-chair and perhaps knawing my hand. I wonder if this is not moment that felt like abandonment. It would have felt like betrayal. It would have felt like, "Hey! This isn't right! He is not supposed to go. I don't want things to change like that. I'm afraid. I'm hurting inside."

If nothing else, the above is a fair representation of the story I have woven about my experiences. That is the narrative, let's say.

## Micro-Goals Revisited

I was thinking about the fact that I get a boost in mood whenever I do something wholesome. If I help someone or send my mother a kind text message, I feel good about it. It's got to be from a wholesome motivation. If I simultaneously feel compassion when I do it, it boosts my self-opinion. If something reinforces my self-belief, I should do it. In fact, if I did just some minimal amount of effort toward an area of self-actualization, I would be happy with myself. This, together with forgiving my frequent shortcomings, should be sufficient to sustain some degree of contentedness. 

What if I did those wholesome activities daily, relentlessly, but without judging myself for the quantity or even quality of the activity? I just do not break the chain, even for a day, exercising. It might be a complete workout when I'm feeling energized and positive. It might be a long walk on a Sunday. It might be just picking up a dumbbell and doing some curls. It just needs to be time spent purposefully exercising.

Maybe I could do this by time-based wholesome micro-goals. Each micro-goal is just to spend _time_, no matter how small a measure of it, doing something _wholesome_. The first example of a wholesome activity is exercise. Let me brainstorm some others that might be candidates.

1. Spend time outside. Stretch: spend time in nature.
1. Spend time exercising. Stretch: do an entire workout.
1. Text a friend, colleague, or family member something wholesome. Stretch: meet up with a friend.
1. Help someone else. Stretch: do some charitable work or give to a charity.
1. Play music. Stretch: play out somewhere.
1. Learn something. Study.
1. Discover something new. Explore, outside, inside, or even online. Stretch: add an Anki card.
1. Celebrate something that happened today, no matter how big or small.


## I Think Too Fast

I have a powerful, quick brain. I am starting to realize I think faster than most people around me, at least when I am "on." The other day, a guy at work, who I already consider very bright, stopped a conversation and said, "Joe, I don't think I think as fast as you." This is a guy who recently recounted a story where he made someone else feel stupid in a meeting. That occasion was even inadvertent. He was smart enough that his normal conversation made someone else feel stupid, and I am smart enough that my normal conversation makes him feel slower than me. My usual disclaimer applies: I am not saying this to stroke my ego. I'm saying it as a lesson to my future self. Keep this in mind, and it will help you understand and relate to people better. You might want to slow down, be patient with others, let them take the time they need to understand something. You might need to plant seeds and water them to get something to grow. For the smarter folks, you might just lead them through the steps in your reasoning. For the very smart folks, you can lead them through leading _you_ through _their_ reasoning.

## 2021-07-27 Comedy Routine

What else is going on right now? Oh, yeah, it's 120 degrees out west. I think it was over 100 degrees around the entire region for a few weeks so far. In Phoenix, Arizona, the high temperature was over 115 degrees for a record-setting six consecutive days, topping out at 118 degrees on June 17. That proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that somebody out there found my mixtape.

And what else is in the news? Oh, now there's California with all these crazy fires, burning up the whole state. It's an inferno like nobody has since since... same thing, mixtape.

I would like to do observational comedy, but I'm an introvert, so it's all about ME, baby! Nobody else. Just me, me, me.

The other day, my wife said, "You are so full of yourself. You act like nobody else matters. Why is that?" I said, "Well, for all I know, you all are figments of my imagination." 

The other day in bed, my wife said, "I'm gonna make you scream tonight." I said, "How?" She said, "I don't know yet, but I've got one hell of an imagination." I sat up and said, "Ha! No you don't! I'm the only one with an imagination in my world!"

The other day I walked into the house trailing a sexy redhead behind me. I said, "Honey, this is Roxy. I brought her home for a threesome." She.. I've never seen her so mad. I thought she was going to start throwing things. She was damn near in tears. She said, "I would never do such a thing!" I consoled her, "Oh, honey, no, you're right, I'm not going to put you through that. The threesome was never going to be with you."

I mean, if you want, you can pull up a chair.

I tend to feel like I'm smart. I know it's a delusion, but it's a sincerely held delusion.

## 2021-07-31 Spa Cleaning

We cleaned the spa today. First, I took most of the furniture out of the porch. While the tub was draining, I got out the pressure washer, and cleaned the floors, walls, and furniture. It takes a few hours to drain. I cleaned the five filters, one at a time. A couple of them were pretty gross, and at least one has some cracks in the media now. They need to be replaced, along with the capsule that goes in the one in the corner. Julie helped do the scrubbing and bailing when the tub got very low.

## Ybor Adventure

Tommy was at school at a band event all day, so when he got home, he was exhausted and slept. Julie and I took the opportunity to go to Ybor City and do some people-watching. We had a crepe and some coffee and walked all the way down 7th and back from our parking space near the Columbia. It was fun. We even got propositioned by a drunk 40-something lady wearing Trump socks. She invited us to a party of "like-minded" individuals. I think she literally winked to accentuate that part. We must give off some vibe, I guess, or she thought we were Trump supporters, maybe because I had my aqua-colored fishing shirt on. I'm not sure. The tickets were only $25, she assured us. We politely declined and kept going.

We walked by a dueling pianos place that was just getting going. Julie looked through the window for a few minutes, apparently waiting for them to start. I offered to go in, but she did not want to. When we were walking back, we could hear the music playing, and she gave me some notes on their early song choices.

## 2021-08-01

## 2021-08-02 Stress Journal

I am going to do a stress journal for the next five full minutes, nonstop. I am typing, not dictating. The idea comes from a book called, _The Stress Management Handbook_ by Eva Selhub, MD.

What is stressing me right now, without holding anything back?

I am distressed that Julie is having a hard time right now. She is better today. Yesterday she was not doing well. She belongs to a Facebook group of female duelers (dueling piano players), and she has been so happy to have it. They have been a sisterhood, a place much more encouraging and positive than the main, co-ed dueler group. The female group is by invitation only, and to some degree they do bitch about men in the group. Recently there was a dust-up where a group member posted about an experience where she felt harassed by a particular male dueler. The name was not used -- this all according to Julie. But someone else on the page, another woman, figured out who she meant by context clues, took screen shots and shared them with the accused man. They then reported the page to Facebook, and the moderators took down the woman's posts. Julie sees it as a betrayal of the sisterhood. The moderators are hiding behind rules. It seems to me the woman who took screenshots did violate the norms of the group, took away the safety of posting there, and that's why Julie is suffering so. To add to it, Jen Porter appears to have sided with the moderator and is taking some kind of moral stand about not telling Julie who it was that took the screen shots (fellow female dueler group member). So Julie is upset with her, too. She was just totally disallusioned with the human race at one point yesterday. She even included me in her condemnation of humans, saying she could not speak freely because I might get upset. I think self-censoring one's speech to protect the feelings of loved ones is not exactly oppression, but, hey, when you're feeling oppressed, anything will do. 

Another thing that is stressing me are some deadlines at work, and generally feeling like I'm always rushing and behind on things. I got assigned as hiring manager for four new people, and that takes time. I also just had an engineer start today, and that takes time. And the engineer he replaces left behind a bunch of unfinished work I have to pick up, and that will take time. And I had to deal with Tom Berry again today. He's meddling in authorship of a contract exhibit. I think I outrank him now, so I should be fine there. And I had to move my office, and that takes time. It's a lot.

I'm always stressed about my parents. I don't really have much of a relationship with either of them, and I feel guilty about that. But whenever I do have an opportunity to interact with them, the interaction invariably adds to my level of stress in life. My mom was her usual odd, hyper-emotional, unabashedly strange self. She probably cried five times in my presence while we were there, about three days. I want her not to suffer, but it is suffering to be around her much. That's harsh, and I would not want her to read this, but this journal is meant to be private, and this is no-holds-barred stress out day.

## 2021-08-11 

PowerPoint slides should be sparse. If the idea is to convey information to the audience, then speaking is a much more natural and fast way to do so. I can speak 150 words per minute. How many words per minute can you get reading slides? And honestly how much reading comprehension can you expect while you are also listening to someone speak to you? The ideal slide deck for me seems like it would consist of a lot of sparse slides with just a couple words or a picture, sprinkled with slides displaying tabular data.

Another not so bad idea might be to just read verbatim a pre-written report over that sparse slide deck. That way you do not make any mistakes. But the listener gets to passively receive the story from you without having to exert themselves to read it. Listening is easier than reading.

I could open a presentation with this:

> Ladies and gentlemen. My presentation is going to be a little unorthodox. I call it a lean presentation. I have a few sparse slides with talking points, pictures, or tabular data, and I will just talk over them. I can speak around 150 words per minute. That's a lot faster than you can read, and listening is easier than reading. Speech has better information density than reading, listening takes less effort than reading, and you can interrupt me and ask questions. It is interactive.

## 2021-08-28 Probability of God

Let $G$ be the event "God exists." If I have no idea either way if it is true, I would assign a probability of 1/2.

$$P(G) = 1/2 = 0.5$$

Now let us look at Bayes Theorem which says:

$$P(A|B) = \dfrac{ P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$

Let's rename the variables. We will let $A=G$ and $B=E$ where $G$ still means "God exists" and $E$ means "evidence." Bayes Theorem becomes:

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ P(E|G) P(G)}{P(E)}$$

$P(A|B)$ becomes $P(G|E)$ which means, "Probability God exists given evidence $E$." $P(E)$ means "the probability of evidence $E$." $P(E|G)$ then means "the probability of evidence $E$ if God exists."

We will re-write the equation in the form for a binary variable, because there are only two options. Either God exists $G$ or God does not exist $\neg G$.

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ P(E|G)P(G) }{ P(E|G)P(G) + P(E|\neg G)P(\neg G)} $$

OK, now what would I assign for the variables on the right-hand side? We already "know" that $P(G) = 1/2$. 

What is the probability of a miracle if God exists, $P(E|G)$? If God exists, I would have no idea what he would do, so I have to assign $P(E|G) = 1/2$, meaning I am indifferent to whether or not he would perform a miracle if he existed.

What is the probability of a miracle if God did not exist, $P(E|\neg G)$? Here I would say that the proability is infintessimally small, say 1/1000000. 

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ 1/2 \times 1/2 }{ 1/2 \times 1/2 + 1/1000000 \times 1/2 } = 500000/500001 =  0.999998$$

This is virtual certainty, which is to be expected. If a _real_ miracle happens, we can be damn shure that God exists, or $G$.

Let's look at the probability of a miracle, $P(E)$. 

Nabakov once said:

> Curiously enough, one cannot read a book; one can only reread it.

My newest wacky idea just now is that I should have a core of, say 5 books that I re-read reguarly. The should contain a lot of information that is directly useful to me. Therefore, something general is better than something specific. They should be something either "timeless" or at least "state-of-the-art." They should be normative as well as informative.

A third worthy subject would be something on the lines of:

1. Arguing
1. Buddhism
1. Critical thinking
1. Engineering
1. Enlightenment
1. Ethics
1. Integrity
1. Law
1. Leadership
1. Logic
1. Math
1. Mindfulness
1. Problem-solving
1. Rationalism
1. Reasoning
1. Writing

There should be one book with subject matter useful to one of the types of "self" that I contain.

1. Physical self (B for Body)
1. Emotional self
1. Ethical self 
1. Financial self
1. Social self

Or maybe these dimensions are better:

1. Personal
1. Interpersonal
1. Social
1. Business
1. Professional

Or the six pursuits of man:

1. Aesthetic
1. Moral
1. Ethical
1. Scientific
1. Economic
1. Political

Here are the candidates that come to mind so far. 

1. _A Primer of Probability Logic_ by Ernest W. Adams.
1. _7 Habtis of Highly Effective People_ by Steven Covey.
1. _An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_ by David Hume.
1. _Extreme Ownership_ by Jocko Wilnic.
1. _The God Delusion_ by Richard Dawkins.
1. _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahneman.
1. _Lying_ by Sam Harris.

## Activity on Arrow Diagram

I want to try something like this one day. I would probably swap the letters and numbers.

## Anki Rules

1. If a note becomes trivially easy, suspend it by typing `!`.
1. If an existing card's answer is a set, break it into attomic chunks.

## My Noble Eightfold Path

**Right View**
: _Seeing things the way they really are_.
: I think I am better at this now than any time in my life.
: By small degrees, I am getting better at seeing through the bullshit and sympathizing with people.

**Right Intention**
: _Intending to renounce my demons, intending to have good-will toward my fellow beings, and having compassion for myself and other beings_.
: I have a pretty good score here. My demons are persistent, but I feel like I am wearing them down. Marijuana is an improvement from alcohol, for example. But why stop there?

**Right Speech**
: _Speaking with kindness and compassion_.
: I am doing better in this department, too. I do make a conscious effort not to speak harshly. I notice when I am speaking harshly. 


**Right Action**
: _Not lying, cheating, stealing, and things like that_.
: I give myself high marks for the negative values here: not lying, for example. Any kind of positive value, like charity or generosity, is not a strong point for me. 

**Right Livelihood**
: _Earning your living in an ethical and non-harming way_.
: I do this. I think my profession is an honorable one. I don't really lie or cheat to get ahead. I truly want to be promoted because I am the best. High marks for this one.

**Right Effort**
: _Putting forth effort to improve oneself in accordance with the Eightfold Noble Path_.
: I maybe get a B or C here. I do like to listen to Joseph Goldstein and even meditate a bit. I am always trying to get better. But I lack some willpower to reduce some unwholesome thoughts.

**Right Mindfulness**
: _The awareness that arises from paying attention, in the present moment, on purpose, and without judgment_.
: One area I need to work on here is the "without judgment" part. I am often judgmental toward myself and others, especially Julie. 

**Right Concentration**
: _Practicing control of directed or choiceless awareness to achieve deeper levels of insight into reality and your inner life. Meditation practice_.
: I do try. It's not as much as it probably should be for my spiritual development and insight. Maybe as I get wiser, I will get more enthusiastic about it.

## 2021-09-07 SafeStart Training Began

For months, I have been leading a project to deliver SafeStart training to the Energy Supply business unit at TECO. It has been a long road. The two training sessions we did today went rather well, and I feel a great amount of relief and pleasure that the project is doing well. There is much work to do, but we will get there.

Each morning for the next few weeks, I will need to get up early and go to Plant City early to get there and set up for the training. But since I do not drink anymore, getting up early is no problem. There is no longer that difference between mornings without drinking and mornings with drinking. I am pretty consistently the same person now, except when I get stressed, I tend not to sleep well, which gives me a bad mood in the morning. This cycle is a hard one for me to break out of, because it would usually result in me doing poorly on something I committed to. I don't like doing that.


## 2021-09-09 Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge

That heading, my friends, is a asyndeton -- the purposeful omission of conjunctions. But this is not what I am here for.

I came across some interesting writing advice from a book called _Legal writing in Plain English_ by Bryan Garner. 

The book mentions a method Dr. Betty Sue Flowers of the University of Texas developed: the Madman, the Architect, the Carpenter, and the Judge.

The job of the Madman is to generate ideas. This means letting ideas flow about what you want to write about. The Judge must be kept away so the Madman can be uninhibited.

The Architect then comes in and organizes the ideas into an outline. This may be done non-linearly first, but the final deliverable from the Architect is the outline. The Judge must be kept away so the Architect can try out ideas freely.

It is important not to let the Judge interfere with the work of the Madman, the Architect, or the Carpenter. Keep the Judge away. He will delay the work of the Carpenter. He can wait.

## Journal of the Madman

It dawned on me that my journal belongs to the Madman. It is full of more or less disconnected ideas, serially written. Each one has enough information to remind me what it was about, but not excess detail. Each entry could be elaborated.

My flow should go like this:

- Work
- Meditate
- Daydream
- Explore
- Write an entry in this journal
- Add one or more Anki cards from the entry

## Supermemo Guy

I enjoy the writing of Supermemo Guy. Supermemo Guy is the author of the Anki predecessor, supermemo. Seems to be some kind of a eccentric creative genius. He writes all these articles on his wiki. He seems to maybe have some expertise in the field of learning and memory.


## Incremental Reading

What I have been doing for the past year and a half or two has a name. It is called "incremental reading." There is WikiPedia page on it.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading>

I read this, and I was like, "I do this now!" My process is as follows:

1. Read some random piece about a subject I am interested in at that moment. It may be a book or article or even a YouTube Video or a Podcast.

2. Spot some nuggets of wisdom in it.

3. Create Anki cards and add them to one of my many decks.

4. Study the Anki cards every day.

I am a little shocked at the moment. It's good that my method has a name and was invented by that weird Piotor character. The other day, I kind of skimmed his lenthy wiki article on incremental reading and was left confused about what it was. I even tried to watch him do it in realtime on a YouTube video. But I was not concentrating enough to see it clearly. Today I read the WikiPedia page, and now I get it.

## Stick Shift Practice

I took Joey out in the Mustang today to try to drive stick shift. He did really well. We just drove around our neighborhood mostly, but we did cross over Brentwood Boulevard to the other side for a little while.

## 2021-09-10

I had this wacky idea today. I think I want to go back to my stupid dream of making a software product so I can get out of my job. I love to program. Maybe now with my new Anki and Progressive Reading skills I can actually do it. But I need a product. What product?

It would be fun if it was related to structural engineering. I think I'm ready to admit that I'm just a structural engineer and nothing more. Well maybe also a possible mentor or some thing for people. But I don't think I want to go into management right now. It's a little too dirty or something. I kind of enjoy the purity of being a structural engineer. I'm kind of trying to build a persona around that.

One downside of making it a structural program, is that I would constantly worry that it was making a mistake. That would not be a good situation, so much so that I wonder of the structural program is the right idea. 

## 2021-09-11 Prolog

For no reason today I suddenly got interested in Prolog. I've been reading about it and making Anki cards for several hours today. It all started when I was sort of daydreaming and brainstorming on the subject of "ideals" for my Ideal-Seeking System idea. Anyway, this is what I wrote on an Apple note.

| Each claim agrees with that which is. 
| Each pair of claims agree. 
| Each action promotes well being. 
| Each agent knows that which is. 
| Each agent knows what promotes well being. 
| Each being is respected. 
| Each action is kind. 
| Each being is an end unto itself. 
| 
| Ideals are states of affairs. 
| Means are ways to reach ideals. 
| Actions apply means. 
| Agents perform actions. 
| Agents are beings.
| Skillful actions promote well being.
| Kindness promotes well being. 
| Agents have minds. 
| Minds produce thoughts. 
| 
| Free time means going where I am pulled. # 2021-09-12 More Prolog

```prolog
/* Facts in the form of simple atoms */
joe.
julie.
tommy.
joey.

/* Facts */
female(julie).
male(joe).
male(joey).
male(tommy).
parent(joe, joey).
parent(joe, tommy).
parent(julie, joey).
parent(julie, tommy).

/* Rules */
mother(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), female(X).
father(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), male(X).
son(X, Y):- parent(Y, X), male(X).
daughter(X, Y):- parent(Y, X), female(X).
```

Let's explain the first rule: `mother(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), female(X).`

This rule means "`X` is the mother of `Y` if `X` is the parent of `Y` and `X` is female". Given this rule, this would evaluate as true: `mother(julie, tommy).`

## Systemic and Systematic

I added this in the extra field to a lot of my Anki cards today, after some research I did yesterday.

| Remember: systemic $\neq$ systematic
| Systemic means "related to the system."
| Systematic means "methodical."

## 2021-09-14

| For analytical and persuasive writing:
| Get your point across quickly with an up-front summary
| Focus the argument
| Make it interesting

## 2021-09-16 Rust Book

I was reading the intro to Rust today at this website:
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/>

I got to the Programming a Guessing Game section.

## TOML

Today I learned about TOML.

<https://toml.io/en/>

 I thought about maybe using it for my determined program for a little bit, but it did not seem to add any value over Python, and I already know Python. So why change?

## The Buddha before Buddhism

This is an audiobook I listened to for a little bit today. It argues that this thing called the book of AIDS is the earliest written text from the Buddha himself, before they were even monks and clergy. It was kind of intriguing me, except then I got interested in something else.

## Rust Guessing Game

Today I did the Rust guessing game programming chapter. Here is my program.

```rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    let mut guesses = 0;

    loop {
        guesses = guesses + 1;
        
        println!("I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.");
        println!("Enter guess #{}", guesses);

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You won in {} guesses!", guesses);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I even made an improvement, which was to include the guest number when the question is asked, and to say how many guesses they won in.

## On Dictation

The best kind of writing would be writing that sounds good when it's read out loud. Speech is our normal way of communication. Reading is the newcomer. Good writing it would seem would sound like someone is speaking to you. The writer is speaking to you. So, what I'm getting at, is that I should probably speak my text more often. I could use my dictation more, not only because of this, but because I can type faster this way. I can easily get a lot of thoughts down without tearing out my fingers. Then I can come back later and put the finishing touches on it during the edit phase. You know, the Judge character.

I am going to wait five minutes, and then edit that paragraph.

The best kind of writing sounds good when it's read out loud. Think about it. When I read something, I often read it "out loud" to myself, in my head. By writing things that sound like speech, we are utiziling the innate machinery dedicated to speech that effortly recognizes, parses, conjugates, and finds the meaning of spoken speech. 

I should use dictation more.

I can easily get a lot of thoughts down without tiring out out my fingers. That gets me the first draft. After that, during the editing phase, I can use the keyboard to apply the finishing touches, for accuracy.

## Rust Integers

| Signed integers in Rust: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, and `i128`.
| Unsigned integers in Rust: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, and `u128`.

The default integer type is `i32`.

When defining variables, long integers can be split up with underscores. The underscore is ignored.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let x = 101_000;
    let y = 101000;
    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
}
```

This results in:

```
Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.97s
    Running `target/debug/playground`
Hello, world!
x = 101000, y = 101000
```

## Rust Floating Types

The two floating types are `f32` and `f64`. `f64` is the default type, because because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision.

Here’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:

`Filename: src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}

```

## Some Thoughts on Scenario Ontology

Here are some thoughts on an ontology of scenarios.

| Candidate Solution | Case 1: Pass | Case 2: Fail |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| A | Scenario A1 | Scenario A2 |
| B | Scenario B1 | Scenario B2 |
| C | Scenario C1 | Scenario C2 |
| D | Scenario D1 | Scenario D2 |

## Writing to a Specific Person

I read this today in the _HBR Guide to Better Business Writing_ by Bryan A. Garner. Write to a specific person in your audience. Think about who is in your audience. I mean individual people that you know in the world. Then pick one of them who is both smart and a generalist, not a specialist. We would say that they do not have more specialized knowledge than the average member of the audience.

The point is to get it down to an individual person that you know in the real world, not some vague "type" of person. 

For structural engineering issues, I could pick a mechanical engineer that I know. I could hone in on the mechanical engineers I know at TECO. But eventually I should narrow it down to one person. That way I can visualize them reading and interpreting it as I go.

What about Dru Latchman? She is pretty smart, and she has a lot of experience. She would probably understand the basics. Writing to her, I would avoid technical jargon like "cantilever". Then again, she might know that word. I could include it in parenthesis to acknowledge that possibility.

I would not write to Sam DeCubellis. He is too crazy. Maybe Brit Johnston would work. He is not particularly good at engineering, but that's average among the engineering managers. The thing is: I at least know him pretty well. I think he would work out better than Bob Bertig.

If I did something like this, I could do away with some formality. 

> The purpose of this report is to summarize the findings of the assessment performed by the structural engineering team.

Could be written like this if I was writing directly to Brit Johnston:

> The structural engineering team assessed the structure, and this report summarizes their findings.

That has the feel of action and result, and it communicates all the information important to state the purpose to the reader.

## 2021-09-18

## Integers for Structural Engineering Software

What if I used integer values for structural engineering software? 

This would have some benefits:

- Eliminate the weirdness of float values.
- Maintain appropriate level of precision.

As an example, suppose we have a variable `delta` which is meant to represent deflection. If it was defined as an integer, we would additionally need to specify how the integer relates to the "real world". In this case, it might be something as simple as:

> `delta` is given in thousandths of an inch (mil).

Thus, a value of `delta=50` means 50 mils or 0.005 inch.

For forces, we might do something like this:

> `P` is given in pounds (lb).

Thus, a value of `P=37000` would mean 37 kips.

The length of a beam might be given as:

> `L` is given in inches (in).

Line loads would be derived from the `P` and `L` values:

> `w` is given in pounds per inch (lb/in).

> `q` is given in pounds per square inch (lb/in$^2$).

Internal stresses would likewise follow the rule for `q`.

> `fb` is given in pounds per square inch (lb/in$^2$).

> `Fb` is given in pounds per square inch (lb/in$^2$).

Let's get an idea of the range of values this would give us.

### Ranges of Values for Integer Mils

There can be no such thing as a negative length in the real world, so we can limit our length variables to unsigned integers, thereby enjoying a larger upper limit. We will look at both C and Python.

Unsigned integers in C can range between 0 and 4,294,967,295. The maximum size of an integer in Python given by `sys.maxsize` is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. This is a very large number indeed. 

| Type | Max. Value | Max. Length |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Unsigned int in C | 4,294,967,295 | ~68 miles |
| Unsigned long long in C | 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | ~145 billion miles |
| Unsigned int in Python | 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 | ~145 billion miles |

**Conclusion:** I would not worry about the integer value in thousandths of an inch overflowing in a structural engineering software package.

### Pounds per Square Mil

What if for pressure we used units of pounds per square mil (lb/mil$^2$)? We could call it _psm_.

| 1 psm = 1,000,000 psi.
| 1 psm = 144,000,000 psf.

OK, this will obviously not work, because a value like 36,000 psi would be less than 1 psm. We need the force and distance units to be compatible, so if we use 0.001 inch we need to use 0.001 pound to go with it. 

| 1 force unit is equal to 1/1000 pound (mip)^[mip].
| 1 length unit is equal to 1/1000 inch (mil).
| 1 pressure unit is equal to 1000 psi (0.001 lb/(0.001 in)$^2$ = 1,000 lb/in).

[mip]: The mip is a unit I may have coined: millipound.

### Numeric Example

Suppose we have a beam that is 20 feet long and supports a load of 2 kips per foot. What is the load in mips per mil?

| 1 foot = 12 inches = 12,000 mils.
| 1 kip = 1,000 pounds = 1,000,000 mips.
| Beam span: 20 ft $\times$ 12,000 mils/ft = 240,000 mils.
| 2 kips $\times$ 1,000,000 mips = 2,000,000 mips.
| 2 kips per foot = 2,000,000 mips/12,000 mils = 167 mips/mil.

We may have a rounding problem. Let's convert back to kips per foot from integer mips per mil.

167 mips/mil $\times$ 1000 mil/in $\times$ 12 in/ft $\times$ 1/1000 lb/in $\times$ 1/1000 kips/lb = 2.004 kips/ft. 

Rounding made little difference, but not zero. We got an extra 4 pounds per foot because of rounding. The thing that seems to throw us off is 12 inches per foot.

### Conclusion

I don't think this idea has much merit. The units blow up when we square them and so forth. Right now I think it would be best to use floats and format them for human readability.

## 2021-09-19

## Read Article about Conditionalization

This is the article: <https://philosophy.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Proper-Formulation-website.pdf>

> "The central notion of Bayesian decision theory is credence (a.k.a. degree of belief, a.k.a. subjective probability)."

I like credence as a synonym for degree of belief and subjective probability.

> "Bayesians study an idealized agent who attaches credences to propositions."

This introduces some terms:
- agent
- credence
- proposition

This article does a good job introducing Bayesian decision making. 

> "Imagine a person whose state of uncertainty is characterized by a 'prior' probability P0 ..., and who is not dogmatic about x, so that 1 > P0(x) > 0."

We have a mathematical definition of _dogmatism_ in the context of Baysian decision-making:

$$ P(x) = 1 \implies \text{ agent is dogmatic} $$

> "Factive formulations assume that the conditioning proposition is true. Non-factive formulations allow that the conditioning proposition may be false."

These are two new terms:
- factive
- non-factive

Consider this:

$$P(E|E) = 1$$

If $E$ is certain, than we must assign credence 1 to $E$. 

> "All ordinary channels of epistemic justification -- - including perception, testimony, memory, introspection, and a priori reasoning --- are subject to error."

This is good. I might want to make this an Anki card.

## Idleness

The opposite of work is idleness. 

## Going To

I was thinking about competency questions as project objectives. Like these:

- Is it going to work?
- Is it going to fit?
- Is it going to provide a benefit?

The answers to these are something like:

- It is going to work.
- It is going to fit.
- It is going to provide benefits.
- It is going to prevent losses.

This formulation of the sentence $X$ is "going to" $Y$ led me to a small insight. These would be very strongly worded objectives for a project. We can just substitue part of the scope into the statement for "it":

- The new system is going to work.
- The new system is going to fit.
- The new system is going to provide benefits.
- The new system is going to prevent losses.

_going to_ is a prediction of the way things will be in a time yet to come. It supposes we are on the path or _going toward_ this future state. But what state of affairs?

The last part after "to" is the desired end state, when married with the subject "the new system". What I mean is the desired end state is the state of affairs where _the new system_ exists and it is doing _work_. We might simply say, "the new system works" is the target end state. 

Good writing displays facts. Bad writing displays itself.

## Ridiculously Good Writing

| **Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 75**
| LXXV. On the Diseases of the Soul

> You have been complaining that my letters to you are rather carelessly written. Now who talks carefully unless he also desires to talk affectedly?[1] I prefer that my letters should be just what my conversation[2] would be if you and I were sitting in one another's company or taking walks together, – spontaneous and easy; for my letters have nothing strained or artificial about them. 2. If it were possible, I should prefer to show, rather than speak, my feelings. Even if I were arguing a point, I should not stamp my foot, or toss my arms about, or raise my voice; but I should leave that sort of thing to the orator, and should be content to have conveyed my feelings to you without having either embellished them or lowered their dignity. 3. I should like to convince you entirely of this one fact, – that I feel whatever I say, that I not only feel it, but am wedded to it. It is one sort of kiss which a man gives his mistress, and another which he gives his children; yet in the father's embrace also, holy and restrained as it is, plenty of affection is disclosed.
> 
> I prefer, however, that our conversation on matters so important should not be meagre and dry; for even philosophy does not renounce the company of cleverness. One should not, however, bestow very much attention upon mere words. 4. Let this be the kernel of my idea: let us say what we feel, and feel what we say; let speech harmonize with life.[3] That man has fulfilled his promise who is the same person both when you see him and when you hear him. 5. We shall not fail to see what sort of man he is and how large a man he is, if only he is one and the same. Our words should aim not to please, but to help. If, however, you can attain eloquence without painstaking, and if you either are naturally gifted or can gain eloquence at slight cost, make the most of it and apply it to the noblest uses. But let it be of such a kind that it displays facts rather than itself. It and the other arts are wholly concerned with cleverness;[4] but our business here is the soul.
> 
> A sick man does not call in a physician who is eloquent; but if it so happens that the physician who can cure him likewise discourses elegantly about the treatment which is to be followed, the patient will take it in good part. For all that, he will not find any reason to congratulate himself on having discovered a physician who is eloquent. For the case is no different from that of a skilled pilot who is also handsome. 7. Why do you tickle my ears? Why do you entertain me? There is other business at hand; I am to be cauterized, operated upon, or put on a diet. That is why you were summoned to treat me!
> 
> You are required to cure a disease that is chronic and serious, – one which affects the general weal. You have as serious a business on hand as a physician has during a plague. Are you concerned about words? Rejoice this instant if you can cope with things. When shall you learn all that there is to learn? When shall you so plant in your mind that which you have learned, that it cannot escape? When shall you put it all into practice? For it is not sufficient merely to commit these things to memory, like other matters; they must be practically tested. He is not happy who only knows them, but he who does them. 8. You reply: "What? Are there no degrees of happiness below your 'happy' man? Is there a sheer descent immediately below wisdom?" I think not. For though he who makes progress is still numbered with the fools, yet he is separated from them by a long interval. Among the very persons who are making progress there are also great spaces intervening. They fall into three classes,[5] as certain philosophers believe. 9. First come those who have not yet attained wisdom but have already gained a place near by. Yet even that which is not far away is still outside. These, if you ask me, are men who have already laid aside all passions and vices, who have learned what things are to be embraced; but their assurance is not yet tested. They have not yet put their good into practice, yet from now on they cannot slip back into the faults which they have escaped. They have already arrived at a point from which there is no slipping back, but they are not yet aware of the fact; as I remember writing in another letter, "They are ignorant of their knowledge."[6] It has now been vouchsafed to them to enjoy their good, but not yet to be sure of it. 10. Some define this class, of which I have been speaking, – a class of men who are making progress, – as having escaped the diseases of the mind, but not yet the passions, and as still standing upon slippery ground; because no one is beyond the dangers of evil except him who has cleared himself of it wholly. But no one has so cleared himself except the man who has adopted wisdom in its stead.
> 
> I have often before explained the difference between the diseases of the mind and its passions. And I shall remind you once more: the diseases are hardened and chronic vices, such as greed and ambition; they have enfolded the mind in too close a grip, and have begun to be permanent evils thereof. To give a brief definition: by "disease" we mean a persistent perversion of the judgment, so that things which are mildly desirable are thought to be highly desirable. Or, if you prefer, we may define it thus: to be too zealous in striving for things which are only mildly desirable or not desirable at all, or to value highly things which ought to be valued but slightly or valued not at all. 12. "Passions" are objectionable impulses of the spirit, sudden and vehement; they have come so often, and so little attention has been paid to them, that they have caused a state of disease; just as a catarrh,[7] when there has been but a single attack and the catarrh has not yet become habitual, produces a cough, but causes consumption when it has become regular and chronic. Therefore we may say that those who have made most progress are beyond the reach of the "diseases"; but they still feel the "passions" even when very near perfection.
> 
> The second class is composed of those who have laid aside both the greatest ills of the mind and its passions, but yet are not in assured possession of immunity.[8] For they can still slip back into their former state. 14. The third class are beyond the reach of many of the vices and particularly of the great vices, but not beyond the reach of all. They have escaped avarice, for example, but still feel anger; they no longer are troubled by lust, but are still troubled by ambition; they no longer have desire, but they still have fear. And just because they fear, although they are strong enough to withstand certain things, there are certain things to which they yield; they scorn death, but are in terror of pain.
> 
> Let us reflect a moment on this topic. It will be well with us if we are admitted to this class. The second stage is gained by great good fortune with regard to our natural gifts and by great and unceasing application to study. But not even the third type is to be despised. Think of the host of evils which you see about you; behold how there is no crime that is not exemplified, how far wickedness advances every day, and how prevalent are sins in home and commonwealth. You will see, therefore, that we are making a considerable gain, if we are not numbered among the basest.
> 
> "But as for me," you say, "I hope that it is in me to rise to a higher rank than that!" I should pray, rather than promise, that we may attain this; we have been forestalled. We hasten towards virtue while hampered by vices. I am ashamed to say it; but we worship that which is honourable only in so far as we have time to spare.[9] But what a rich reward awaits us if only we break off the affairs which forestall us and the evils that cling to us with utter tenacity! 17. Then neither desire nor fear shall rout us. Undisturbed by fears, unspoiled by pleasures, we shall be afraid neither of death nor of the gods; we shall know that death is no evil and that the gods are not powers of evil. That which harms has no greater power than that which receives harm, and things which are utterly good have no power at all to harm.[10] 18. There await us, if ever we escape from these low dregs to that sublime and lofty height, peace of mind and, when all error has been driven out, perfect liberty. You ask what this freedom is? It means not fearing either men or gods; it means not craving wickedness or excess; it means possessing supreme power over oneself And it is a priceless good to be master of oneself. Farewell.

## Poetry

| You shouldn't chase after the past
| or place expectations on the future.
| What is past
| 	is left behind.
| The future
| 	is as yet unreached.
| Whatever quality is present
| you clearly see right there,
| 	   right there.
| Not taken in,
| unshaken,
| that's how you develop the heart.
| Ardently doing
| what should be done     today,
| for — who knows? —  tomorrow
| 	death.
| There is no bargaining
| with Mortality & his mighty horde.
| 
| Whoever lives thus ardently,
| 	relentlessly
| 	both day & night,
| has truly had an auspicious day:
| so says the Peaceful Sage.

It's really just a concise paragraph conveying some wisdom, with dramatic pauses conveyed by indenting and splitting up long lines. I could do this. Just write something brilliant, and after that add dramatic pauses by indenting and splitting up long lines.

[_] Have I been utterly truthful?
[_] Have I said all that I need to say?
[_] Have I been appropriately diplomatic and fair?
[_] Do I have three parts to the piece—an opener, a middle, and a closer?
[_] In my opener, have I made my points quickly and clearly? And concretely?

## My Life Commitments

It seems like I only have these commitments right now:

1. Supporting my family, financially.
2. Getting Joey set up as an independent adult.
3. Getting Tommy set up as an independent adult.
4. Saving enough to retire.
5. Maintaining my marriage.

I go to work because of Commitments 1 and 4. Any time I spend parenting the boys is for Commitments 2 and 3. These seem to group themselves together a little. 

1. Providing.
1. Parenting.
1. Adulting.

I provide food, shelter, medicine, dental care, and clothing to my wife, my kids, my dog, and myself. I provide parental care and advice to the kids. I plan for their educational expenses. I try to make sure they each feel valued and supported. I try to do special things with them: with Tommy they are mostly guitar-related, and with Joey it's a grab bag of things. Driving is one. We previously gave running and working out with weights a try. And last, but by no means least is being a grown-up with Julie as my partner. This is a good commitment to have. I call it adulting.

## Letters to Joey

Julie had a good suggestion tonight. I could start writing emails to Joey. I mean philosophical emails, emails that impart wisdom. They would be more like epistles or letters than emails. Picture, if you will, my own imperfect imitation of the epistles of Seneca the Younger and Thomas Jefferson. It's to learn to write as well as they do that motivates me to consider this project.

I have been recently reading books and articles about writing, especially ones written by Brian Garner. He is a lawyer who writes books about writing, written for lawyers. That's not why I am interested in him. I just love the quality of his writing style. It's a great writer who wants to write to me to help me become a great writer: win-win.

Bryan endorses a system of writing where you first brainstorm, then outline, then draft quickly, and finally revise and edit.[^macj] He calls it the Madman, the Architect, the Carpenter, and the Judge, names he adopted from an English professor named Betty S. Flowers.

[^macj]: I used some of this technique for this section of my journal. The parts I used were the Carpenter and Judge parts. First, I wrote the section very quickly, using dictation. Second, I re-read it and made edits along the way. And third, I read it out loud and made some final edits. I wanted it to sound natural when read aloud.

My aspiration, for the first letter at least, is to brainstorm each Tuesday night, outline Wednesday night, revise and edit Thursday night, and then do a final revision and send it on Friday night. That is a comfortable pace that will not be too much of a burden: I expect only 15-20 minutes per night. 

I like the idea. Tonight I entered some ideas into a mind map, coming up with an assortment of topics in orbit about the concept of the letter-writing idea itself. Tomorrow I will attempt to outline.

## Word Count Analysis

Note, this section contains 328 words organized into sentences approximately 13 words in length; Bryan Garner recommends an average of 20 words per sentence. <https://countwordsworth.com/sentences>

## Letter Writing

These are some notes from inspecting the book, _How to Write First-Class Letters, the handbook for practical letter writing_ by L. Sue Baugh. I have it as an `.epub` file.

- Letter writing is a form of dialogue.
- Make your leters _recipient_-based rather than _writer_-based.
- Letter writing is a simple three-step process:
    1. Prewriting, which means asking these four questions, and then gathering pertinent information on the subject:
        1. What is my purpose?
        1. Who is my audience?
        1. What should the letter cover?
        1. What action or response do I want?
    1. Writing, which means writing the entire thing all the way through to the end. Just write until you have a complete letter.
    1. Revising.
- Revising includes a lot of things:
    - Challenging vague words.
    - Deleting unnecessary points.
    - Deleting unnecessary words.
    - Deleting fancy words.
    - Deleting irrelevant premises.
    - Double-checking facts, figures, and references.
    - Proofreading for grammar

I'm not sure I prefer this over the Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge model. I think I will marry the two. The part I like about this one are the four questions whenever you write a letter.

1. What is my purpose?
1. Who is my audience?
1. What should the letter cover?
1. What action or response do I want?

## Relations and Relationships

I was trying to figure out if object-oriented programming used the word _relation_ or _relationship_, so I did two Google searches to find out.

| `"oop" "relationships" -relations` gave 961,000 results.
| `"oop" "relations" -relationships` gave 2,120,000 results.

It appears, then, that **relations** is the winner.

I have an idea for an app that lets you track things that you consider earning merit. I named it ironically after my grandfather, Merritt Davis. This gives it a distinctive name that will be easier to Google.

The minimum viable product would feature:

1. One list of activities.
1. The ability to check or uncheck items on the activities list.
1. A reset script that runs every day.
1. A reminder screen to check off items from the day before.
1. The date prominently featured at the top of the page.

## Risks in Society

When dealing with risks in projects, I wonder if we should always speak of "risk of X". Rather than just "risk". Mr. makes sense grammatically to me. Ask what the risks are, someone's response would be, there is a risk of A, a risk of B, and a risk of C.

![Risks in Society](images/risks-in-society.png)

For one event with potential consequences, risk, $R$, is equal to the probability that the event will occur, $P$, multiplied by the consequences given the event occurs, $C$.

$$R = P \times C$$

The formula is only provided as a foundation for the following formula, which would be for an activity with $n$ events that could cause consequences.

$$R = \sum_{i=1}^n P_i \times C_i$$

From this model, we can see:

- An activity, $A$, is associated with $n$ potential outcomes, $i$.
- Each potential outcome, $i$, has an expected consequence, $C_i$.
- Each potential outcome, $i$, has an anticipated probability, $P_i$.
- The risk of outcome, $i$ is given by: $R_i = P_i \times C_i$.

Let's try re-writing the formula, then.

$$x \in A, R(A) = \sum P(x|A) C(x)$$

| $A$ is an activity.
| $x$ is an outcome.
| $P(x|A)$ is the probability of outcome $x$ given activity $A$.
| $C(x)$ is the consequence of outcome $x$.
| $R(A)$ is the total risk associated with activity $A$.

What does _activity_ mean then? Take activity here to mean any activity from the smallest thing like walking across a room to larger things like projects. A project, then, under this model would be an activity, ontologically.

Now, let's go back and look at the table [Risks in Society]. The first column, "Approximate death rate", appears to be what Kahneman and Tversky would call "base rates." 

The second column, "Typical exposure" is interesting. Recently learned that exposure is usually interchangeable with probability. But if we follow this table, exposure is not equivalent to probability. Probability would be exposure times base rate. 

Third column, "Typical risk of death," is strange, too. I think it should be probability, not risk. The only thing that makes it risk is that the consequence is included: death.

Another insight from this table is that construction work is wildly riskier than structural failures. I should keep this in mind when making decisions.

"Risk of death" should be expanded to "risk of death for an activity is the base rate times in events per hour times the exposure in hours." Here _death_ is a consequence. The total risk for the activity would be the sum of the risk of each consequence given the activity, base rate, and exposure.

![Risk-Based Decision Analysis Process](images/risk-based-decision-analysis.png)

![Risk-Based Decision Analysis Process](images/risk-based-decision-analysis-annotated.png)

Item #3 techniques:

- Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)
- Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
- Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)
- Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP)
- Risk Screening (Hazid Sessions)

For analysis of consequences (#4) consider using pairwise comparisons made by experts.

Base evaluation of probabilities (#5) on failure rates for electrical or mechanical systems and structural reliability for structures. Consider Monte Carlo analysis.

What if scenarios are used to analyze sensitivities (#7).

In risk treatment (#9) we compare calculated risks to acceptable risks stated in the risk acceptance criteria. Then unacceptable risks are handled by one of the following means:

1. Risk mitigation. Modify the system to remove the risk.
1. Risk reduction. Act to reduce the probability or consequences.
1. Risk transfer. Buy insurance, for example.
1. Risk acceptance. Adjust the risk acceptance criteria to accept the risk.

We then monitor and review (#10). This feedback loop improves the process.

## A Positive Affirmation

Add this positive affirmation to my Anki deck:

> "I am at peace with all that has happened, is happening, and will happen."

I think what it means is three things. You might as well be at peace with what has happened, because it cannot be changed now. It will be at peace with what is happening, because the causes of it are so complicated that you can't possibly control them. And likewise for what will happen. The chain of events from this moment forward is also not under your control.

## Do Myself or Delegate?

![TECO Salary Analysis 2021](images/teco-salary-analysis-2021.png)

 taking into account all the hours I spend earning money at TECO, including commuting and free overtime, I make about $50 per hour in take-home pay. Some of that goes directly to 401(k) and savings. 

 When considering whether I should attempt to do something myself, I should use this formula:

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{P(S|M)} \geq \dfrac{\times C}{P(S|D)}$$

| Where:
| $S$ = Success.
| $P()$ = Probability.
| $M$ = Do it myself.
| $D$ = Delegate it.
| $C$ = Cost paid to delegate it.
| $P(S|M)$ = Subjective probability of success if I do it myself.
| $P(S|D)$ = Subjective probability of success if I delegate it myself.
| $H$ = Hours I estimate it will take me to do it myself.

Let's do a trial run here and look at Joey's neon light. I have tried over and over to fix it, unsuccessfully. That money is gone - a sunk cost - so I will ignore it. 

I estimate my probability of success to be 50%. I am totally unsure if I can fix it. I estimate hours at 4. So the left-hand side becomes:

$$\dfrac{4 \times 50}{0.50} = 400$$

I estimate the probability of success of a delegated solution to be 99%. I estimate the cost as $500. So the right-hand side becomes:

$$\dfrac{500}{0.99} = 505$$

According to my formula, then, I should try to do it myself. It is close.

To be indifferent to the decision, we set the two sides equal. Then we can solve for $H$ that would make it worthwhile.

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{0.50} = \dfrac{500}{0.99}$$

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{0.50} = 505$$

$$H = \dfrac{0.50 \times 505}{50} = 5.05\text{ say } \underline{5\text{ hours}}$$

## Joe as a System

## Our Family as a System

### Components

{ Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, possessions }

Possessions include all the things we legally control.

### External Systems

The external systems are infinite in number. We probably want to settle on a few of greater interest.

{ extended family, employer, consumer economy, legal system, government, social group }

### Resources

We have both tangible and intangible resources. Our possessions are tangible resources. The goodwill we have with other systems is an intangible resource we can tap into.

### System Benefactors

Benefactors include anybody who benefits from the family system. The family members are the obvious primary three.

{ Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Elaine, Bob, Terry, Ron, family, social group (all levels), society (all levels) }

The Users of the system are only the five of us dependent living things: { Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Maggie }

### System Life Cycle

| **Stage 1:** Joe and Julie
| **Stage 2:** Joe, Julie, and Joey
| **Stage 3:** Joe, Julie, Joey, and Tommy
| **Stage 4:** Julie, Joey, and Tommy
| **Stage 5:** Joey and Tommy
| **Stage 6:** Tommy

We are in Stage 3 right now. The next stage transition will be when Joe dies, moving to Stage 4. After Julie dies at a ripe, old age, Joey and Tommy will continue into Stage 5. Joey is older and so will die sooner, moving into Stage 6 until Tommy dies of old age. This is the system life cycle of the family of Joe and Julie.

### System Operating Domain

The family's sphere of influence extends at least as far as Europe. I don't know what more to say about this. It seems more applicable to systems like aircraft.

### System Frame of Reference

Our _physical_ frame of reference:

| The physical location of each system element (person or possession)
| 819 Walsingham Way, Valrico, Florida, United States of America
| North America
| Western Hemisphere
| Northern Hemisphere
| Planet Earth
| Earth's Solar System
| Milky Way Galaxy
| The Milky Way's Galactic Cluster
| The Milky Way Galactic Cluster's Super Cluster

There is one _temporal_ frame of reference:

- Current period in history

There is one _moral_ frame of reference:

- Current moral Zeitgeist

There is one _ethical_ frame of reference:

- Societal norms

Our _familial_ frame of reference includes:

- McCoy extended family
- Legner extended family

Our _social_ frame of reference includes:

- Friends of any family member
- Our neighborhood
- Our community
- Our county
- Our state
- Our country
- Western democratic society
- Western society
- Human society

### Higher Order Systems

Higher order systems govern, direct, constrain, and control the operation and performance of the Legner Family system. These systems provide resources for missions.

- Universal society (imagined)
- Intergalactic society (imagined)
- Interplanetary society (imagined)
- Human society
- Civilized human society
- International society
- Federal society
- State society
- County society
- Local society
- HOA
- Employers

### Purpose-Based Role

The purpose of the family is to benefit its benefactors. The vision is for all its benefactors to be thriving.

### System Missions

The family system performs missions in fulfillment of its purpose to achieve outcome-based performance objectives established by its owners and users.

- Provide what is needed for each family member to flourish
- Add value to higher order systems

### Mission Goals and Performance Objectives

Given the two missions above, what are the mission goals? Each goal must be supported by one or more specific objectives that are quantifiable, measurable, testable, and verifiable. This is something we need to work on.

- Goal #1: Safety
- Goal #2: Life-Long Learning
- Goal #3: Financial Stability
- Goal #4: Kids Independent
- Goal #5: Retirement

**Goal #1:** Safety

- Objective #1-1: Zero accidental injuries
- Objective #1-2: Zero violent crimes
- Objective #1-3: Acceptable self-reported mental health

**Goal #2:** Life-Long Learning

- Objective #2-1:  
- Objective #2-2: 
- Objective #2-3: 

**Goal #3:** Financial Stability

- Objective #3-1: 
- Objective #3-2: 
- Objective #3-3: 

**Goal #4:** Kids Independent

- Objective #4-1: 
- Objective #4-2: 
- Objective #4-3: 

**Goal #5:** Retirement

- Objective #5-1: 
- Objective #5-2: 
- Objective #5-3: 

### System Operating Constraints and Conditions

- Volitional acts are constrained by societal rules. This happens at many levels of description.
- The physical world is constrained by physical laws. This also happens at many levels of description.
- The system's capabilities are constrained by the family members' competencies.

### System Utility

The system provides physical, psychological, sociological, financial, and economic _value-added utility_ to its Users, namely the four family members.

- Physical
    - Protection
    - Health care
    - Dental care
- Psychological
    - Love
    - Caring
    - Kindness
- Sociological
    - Teaching
    - Belonging
- Financial
    - Savings
    - College savings
    - Retirement savings
- Economic
    - Income
    - Insurance
    - Legal services

### System Suitability

The family system is suited to providing support to its Users.

### System Success Criteria

Success means User acceptance and level of satisfaction. A User means one of { Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Maggie }.

### Mission Reliability

This is the probability of success in accomplishing mission objectives for a specified mission duration and set of operating environment conditions and scenarios.

### System Effectiveness

Each stakeholder has its own opinion of the effectiveness of a system. 

### System Efficiency

The family system is not very efficient.

### System Integrity

I'm not sure what _level of integrity_ means.

### System Sustainment

This includes the inputs needed to sustain the family system. Such inputs are obtained from outside the family system. For example, money, food, and all manner of manufactured products are all used to sustain the family system.

### System Promotion

The family system does not really promote itself. I would say this is not applicable.

### System Threats

Threats to the family are numerous.

1. Accident
1. Violence
1. Animals
1. Insects
1. Viruses
1. Bacteria
1. Financial problems
1. Betrayal

### System Concealment

The system does not conceal itself.

### System Protection

Protective measures include:

1. Locks and keys
1. Smoke alarms
1. Fire extinguishers
1. Insurance policies
1. Weapons
1. Passwords

### System Security

The family system is most concerned with physical security: PHYSEC.

### System Architecture

The system is a traditional human family consisting of two married parents, male and female, and two offspring, both male. It also includes a dog.

### System Capabilities

1. Provide money
1. Provide goods and services
1. Provide for physical needs of family members
1. Provide for emotional needs of family members
1. Provide education
1. Connects individuals
1. Defends against threats
1. Provides opportunities for growth

### System Concept of Operations

The two parents call the shots, but with significant input from the two kids. The dog does not have much say.

### System Phases, Modes, and States of Operation

1. Problem mode
1. Adventure mode
1. Normal mode

### Operating Norms, Standards, and Conventions

Family members:

1. Treat each other with respect and honesty
1. Speak and behave with integrity
1. Act with kindness
1. Help each other

### System Description

The system consists of a traditional human family with four human members and a canine.

1. Joe Legner, age 48, male, engineer.
1. Julie Legner, age 46, female, musician.
1. Joey Legner, age 18, male, student.
1. Tommy Legner, age 16, male, student.
1. Maggie, age 12, female, dog.

Joe and Julie are married.

The dog is adopted.

### System Sensors

1. Communications devices
1. Cameras
1. Recording devices

### System Behavior Patterns

1. School and work pattern.
1. School break and work pattern.
1. Vacation pattern.
1. Holiday pattern.

### System Responsiveness and Sensitivity

I don't know what to say here.

### System Interfaces

1. Meeting face-to-face
1. Email
1. Phones
1. Mail

### System Pedigree

The system pedigree is an unbroken chain of human families, most recently the immediate family of Joe's parents and the immediate family of Julie's parents. The system evolved from these two ancestors with a lot of wisdom and experience drawn from the world beyond the two ancestral family units.

## Rust Program Test

Refer to [2020-10-17 Nim Language Experiment]. I replicated this program in Rust as follows.

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut heads_rolled: bool;
    let mut heads_count: usize = 0;
    let mut tails_count: usize = 0;
    let mut n = 0: usize;

    loop {
        heads_rolled = random();
        if heads_rolled {
            heads_count += 1;
        } else {
            tails_count += 1;
        }
        if heads_count + tails
    }
    println!("{} heads and {} tails", heads_count, tails_count);
}
```

The results were:
```bash
$ time ./target/release/coin_toss_rust
500651 heads and 499348 tails
./target/release/coin_toss_rust  0.01s user 0.00s system 87% cpu 0.016 total
```

| Language |  Time | Ratio to Python | Ratio to NIM | Ratio to Rust |
|----------|------:|:---------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| Python   | 1.150 |       1         |     16    |      72   |
| Nim      | 0.074 |        -        |      1    |      4.6     |
| Rust     | 0.016 |        -        |       -      |      1     |

Rust is easily the fastest. It makes Python look stupid. It is even about 5 times faster than Nim which is already much faster than Python.

## Entity and Component Architecture

1. An Entity is nothing but a unique identifier, usually an integer.
1. A component is a piece of data. It should be kept very atomic, but it can have more than one field.
1. An aspect is a set of components.

## Improvement Methodologies

<http://jamme.acmsse.h2.pl/papers_vol43_1/43155.pdf>

The **PDCA cycle** is a well known fundamental concept of continuous- improvement processes.

**RADAR matrix** provides a structured approach assessing the organizational performance.

**DMAIC** is a systematic, and fact based approach providing framework of results-oriented project management.

**DFSS** is a systematic approach to new products or processes design focusing on prevent activities.

## Entity Component System Architecture

```python
import random

class Entity:

    def __init__(self):
        self.key = random.randint(1, 1000000000)

class Component1:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data1A = ...
        self.data1B = ...
        self.data1C = ...

class Component2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data2A = ...
        self.data2B = ...
        self.data2C = ...

class Component3:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data3A = ...
        self.data3B = ...
        self.data3C = ...

def create_entity_type1():
    return Entity(Component1(), Component2(), Component3())
```

Let's try something a little more interesting.

```python
import random

class Entity:
    def __init__(self, *args):
        self.key = random.randint(1, 1000000000)
        self.components = list(args)    # not sure this works, but you get the idea

class Position:
    def __init__(self, lat, lon, draft):
        self.lat = lat
        self.lon = lon
        self.draft = draft

class Bearing:
    def __init__(self, angle):
        self.angle = angle

class ForwardVelocity:
    def __init__(self, knots):
        self.knots = knots

def create_vessel(lat, lon, draft, bearing, velocity):
    "A vessel is an entity with position, bearing, and forward velocity."
    return Entity(Position(lat, lon, draft), Bearing(bearing), ForwardVelocity(velocity))

def has_component(entity, component):
    "Return true if entity has component"
    return component in [type(c) for c in e.components]

def has_components(entity, components):
    "Return true if entity has these components"
    retval = True
    for component in components:
        retval = retval and has_component(entity, component)
    return retval

def physics_system(entity):
    if has_components(entity, (Position, ForwardVelocity, Bearing)):
        pass
        # Now how do I get the data when I need it??


if __name__ == "__main__":
    entity_context = set()
    entity_context.add(create_vessel(lat=83.442, lon=66.4321, draft=8.5, bearing=53.5, velocity=4.5))

    # TODO: create an over-arching loop
    for e in entity_context:
        print(f"Entity {e.key}")
        physics_system(e)

```


Come to think of it, you don't need to generate random keys. Why not just start with zero? You will have to maintain a list of numbers so you can delete them in the middle when things get removed in the model. Each new entity just gets the next available integer. It's probably best not to re-use deleted ones, in case there is some kind of undo feature later. We will also have to keep track of the last number we generated. 

On second thought, it would be better to keep it a simple list of integers. It could even be a list of booleans, because all you need is the position in the list and a boolean telling you if it is valid (True) or deleted (False).

Rather than delete from the entity context, I would probably just set the value to None. 

### World Class

The entities, components, and systems (processors) should all belong to a world. Or maybe it should be called a "model". Anyway, something needs to own everything, including the system instances.

```python
entities = []
components = []
processors = []


class Beam:
    def __init__(self, w, L):
        self.L = L
        self.w = w


def create_entity():
    entities.append(len(entities))
    return len(entities)-1

def create_component(e, c):
    c.entity = e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_component(Beam(L=24.5, w=0.94))

## Joe's Productivity Theory

$$P \geq D$$

$$P = R \times T$$

$$R \times T \geq D$$

$$R \geq \frac{D}{T}$$

$$T \geq \frac{D}{R}$$

$$R = E \times L \times (1 - W) \times U$$

$T$ = Time

$P$ = Productivity in units

$R$ = Productivity rate in units per unit time

$D$ = Demand in units

$E$ = Effort: 0=no effort, 1=greatest possible human effort that can be sustained indefinitely.

$L$ = Leverage: a number greater than 1, where 1 represents no leverage, only the amount of effort of a single, unaided person. Thus, a leverage of $L=2$ means twice the amount of effort of an unaided person.

$W$ = Waste: 0=no moment is lost, 1=no moment is productive.

$U$ = Utilization rate: 0=no time is productive, everything is training, staff meetings, or vacations to 1=all time is productive; there is no training, staff meetings, or vacations.

## Overtime

A year has 2,080 hours. From this number we must subtract eight hours for each holiday and vacation day. Subtract 9 holidays and 20 vacation days. This amounts to subtracting 232 hours for a net of 1,848 hours. We also need to subtract training and community service days. Let's subtract 6 days or 48 hours for those. We are now down to 1,800 hours, a nice round number! By this estimate, in one calendar year we are at work 225 days.

Now we have to get more granular. 

There are many things that do not amount to a full day. The obvious ones is meetings of a kind that are outside of production. Most meetings are non-productive in this sense: you are not working on the work products promised by a project. You are working on a schedule or something outside projects. Let's assume, on average, that 2 hours per day is spent in meetings like this. Anyone working where I work would laugh at how low that estimate is. But assuming it is 2 hours, we are going to have to subtract $225 \times 2 = 450$ hours from productive working time.

How much do we have now? 1,800 - 450 = 1,350 hours available to do actual productive work. I am not saying we are productive during this work time by any means. We walk around, get a drink, use the restroom, check our social media, clip our fingernails, brush our teeth, and do a hundred other things. But let's say we are in busy mode. We do these little things, but we are pretty well occupied most of the time outside meetings. We can call it the "busy, not rushed" level of effort. 

So, we start with 1,350 hours of busy, not rushed level of effort. Now let's talk about overtime.

Let's make everyone really busy, add two hours per day. This adds 450 hours of additional productive work.

Another thing to consider about the overtime: is it just as productive? It can't be. People get burned out and low, for one thing. People get worn out, during the day even. 

Ignoring wear-out, we have increased our productivity from 1,350 to 1,800 hours. Not bad. This is an increase of 1/3. So, if an engineer could design 24 projects in a year without overtime, she could design 32 projects in a year with overtime.

But let's account for the weight of the overtime on productivity. This is a lot of overtime to sustain for an entire year. I think as time went on, people are probably going to check out, and we won't end up with even an hour per day of added productivity. In other words, even if you make them stay, you are not going to get more than 1 extra hour out of folks after indefinite lengths of time continuously working that hard. I am assuming all along that they are not paid for overtime. 

Now we only get 225 more hours of productive work in a year. We have only increased our productivity from 1,350 to 1,575 hours. This is an increase of 1/6. 

But what does this do for morale? Do we get more absenteeism? Do we get more turnover? Probably. 

We would do 24 projects at a nice leisurely pace. With a ton of overtime, we will do 28 projects. Is it worth it? Why not have happier employees working at a nice flow and get 24 projects done, and retain everyone for as long as we want them.

## Tommy Sick

Tommy came down with a fever today. It was at first about 99 degrees, and later increased to about 101. 

## 2021-11-05

## Tommy Update

Tommy's fever is over already, but he says he still does not feel well. He complains of a headache and stomach issues. Julie took him to get a COVID-19 test, but the results will take a few more days.

## Frank Pirillo

Today I went to the offices of Enercon and saw Frank Pirillo. When DcR Engineering closed, Frank and his remaining colleagues all got hired by Enercon. While I was there, Gerry Chasse, Chief Operating Officer of TECO came into the room. Later I made a joke to him. "I like it when you're around," I said. "If I'm talking to someone I don't want to talk to, I just point at you and say, 'Do you see that guy over there? He's the COO of Tampa Electric,' and they hurry over to talk to you."

## Got up Early

Today I got up at 5 am so I could get to work by 6 am for the Transportation Operations monthly safety meeting. The manager of the linemen, Chuck Rogers, told me he did not expect me to show up. I told him, "These are my customers. I need to get to know them." That probably made a good impression. It was sincere.

## Interviews

Today I interviewed two candidates for engineer for my new department: Zachary Scott and Thamee Thet. This is going to be hard. They both did great. 

I think Thamee was a little more polished and mature-sounding than Zackary. But Zackary has poured his everything into his life. His work ethic is legendary. He currently is working shift work, meaning 12-hour days, and he's also taking classes for a Master's Degree, earning A's, and taking care of a family with two kids. His wife is also taking classes. 

The other candidate earlier this week is Zackary Boyd, also a strong candidate. He has been focusing on earning a seat at Transmission Engineering. He has targeted this position and worked toward developing himself to get in. Any of the three would be good. 

I have a certain affinity for Ms. Thet, what with her having been my co-op two years ago. 

## Christmas Decorations

Tommy is excited about Christmas. Since we are traveling to Colorado next week, he asked if we could set up the Christmas decorations early so we could enjoy them immediately upon arrival back home. That was so sweet that, despite being tired from my early rising, I helped him take down the Christmas boxes from the Attic and then put up the Thanksgiving boxes. After that I was done, so here I am writing this journal. 

It's 8:34 pm on Wednesday, November 17, 2021. I am seated at an Ikea desk typing on a Mac Mini at 819 Walsingham Way in Valrico, Florida. I'm wearing green shorts, my Sperry slippers, a shirt that reads: "My favorite people call me dad," and headphones. I'm not listening to anything but the click of my ancient IBM Model M buckling-spring keyboard. The keyboard was made on October 21, 1988. That means it is 33 years, 27 days old today. Julie (McCoy) Legner is my wife. Our anniversary was October 23, 2021. Our two sons are Joey (18) and Tommy (16). We are all healthy tonight. Even the dog is healthy.

I do not know what tomorrow will bring.

## Anki Cards

I think my Anki cloze cards are excessive. Some go up to `c7` and maybe even `c8`. I wonder if I should make them more atomic. What would an atomic card be like? Here are some competing ideas.

- Each card conveys one bit of information.
- Each card conveys one binary relation.

Let's examine an example.

```
{{c5::Bhāvanā::Pali word}} literally means {{c1::developing}}, {{c2::cultivating}}, or {{c3::producing}} in the sense of "calling into {{c4::existence}}".
```

This card is about the Pali word Bhavana. It has five (5) cloze deletions. Should it? Is it really worth my time to memorize it verbatim? I don't think that adds value. The value is the Bhavana part. That's the new information I'm trying to learn. Let's re-formulate it more atomically:

```
{{c1::Bhāvanā::Pali word}} literally means developing, cultivating, or producing in the sense of "calling into existence".
```

This will save me umpteen reviews moving forward.

Here is another one:

```
Consider your {{c1::purpose}} and your {{c2::audience::a...}} before you begin writing, and let these guide both {{c3::what}} you say and {{c4::how you say it}}.
```

What's the point of this? Your purpose and audience should inform and constrain the writing process. Let's re-write it as its essence:

```
Your {{c1::purpose}} and {{c2::audience}} should inform and constrain the writing process.
```

## My Types of Close Notes

### Contrast Note

Some notes contrast two items. Here is an example contrasting the word "drastic" from the word "dramatic":

```
{{c1::Dramatic}} denotes attention-getting or extreme results, while {{c2::drastic}} refers to rapid, violent, or severe actions.
```

Could this be improved upon? Maybe it could become two atomic cards, for example:

```
{{c1::Dramatic::Dramatic | Drastic}} denotes attention-getting or extreme results.
```

```
{{c1::Drastic::Dramatic | Drastic}} refers to rapid, violent, or severe actions.
```

I did not make this change. 

### Formula Note

Some give math, engineering, or financial formulas or equations.

### Image Occlusion Note

Some cards have a diagram, figure, photo, or map with features masked.

### List Note

Some cards have a list to memorize.

### Procedure Note

A procedure note gives a sequence of steps to accomplish an objective. For it to add value, it seems like all these should be true:

- Q1: Is it correct? Does it work?
- Q2: Does it come up often enough to be worth worrying about?

Here is an example from my current deck.

```
What are the five steps for hypothesis testing?
Step 1 - State the {{c1::null}} and {{c1::alternative}} hypotheses
Step 2 - Set the {{c2::threshold}} of the test
Step 3 - Assume the {{c4::null}} hypothesis is {{c3::true}}.
Step 4 - Calculate the {{c5::p-value}}.
Step 5 - State your {{c6::conclusion}}.
```

For this one, Q1 is true and Q2 is false. I should simplify or eliminate it.

### Quote Note

Some cards have sayings, aphorisms, or quotes that I believe are worth learning verbatim. 

### Social Note

Some of my notes are for memorizing facts about people I interact with: the name of their spouse, their favorite thing, hobby, etc. These are intended to strengthen my social intelligence.

### Trivia Note

Some notes just give little facts I think it's fun to know or might make me look smart in front of others. Here is an example.

```
1 pound = {{c1::7000}} grains.
```

Is this useful to me? Not really. It's fun, somehow. Maybe it feeds that childlike want to be seen as smart.

### Vocabulary Note

Some notes just give word definitions. They are similar to the trivia notes.

## Prosocial Behavior and Self-Serving Behavior

My newest hypothesis having read this blog entry: <https://quillette.com/2021/11/29/the-universal-structure-of-storytelling/>

> Human psychology involves a tension between two opposing priorities: prosocial behavior and self-serving behavior.

The thesis of the article seems to be this claim:

> Storytelling developed as a way to indoctrinate and condition prosocial behavior in members of the tribe, with the good guys righteously opposing the bad guys.

The "good" part of the good guys describes behaviors that move the state of affairs _toward_ the flourishing of the good guys' group, and the "bad" part of the bad guys describe behaviors that tend to split up the good guys' group.

## Journaling

It's probably good to journal, because you are really thinking for yourself. You are not reading. You are creating something new from your own ideas. It seems like synthesizing new ideas from your existing ones is the best thing you could do to learn. You are doing what the gurus say: connecting the new stuff to the old stuff. You can even connect old stuff to old stuff. Either way is truly insight. 

I went for a short walk tonight while I listened to Joseph Goldstein. I also smoked, so there's that. I definitely feel some emotional catharsis from doing it. It might also be that I worked hard enough today to allow myself to really relax. I did enough. I can relax. That's not a feeling I have very often. 

I have a hypothesis. Let's put it this way: Usually I feel guilty, like I should be doing more. I wonder if that goes back to the time my mom called me lazy. That stung a lot! Maybe this older being is still sore about it and always trying to prove her wrong.

I think it was right to make the preceding paragraph a hypothesis, by adding that first short sentence. You don't have to over-think things when it's a hypothesis. It's kind of light.

## Personas of Purpose

My three "Personas of Purpose," as I call them, are:

1. The Family Man
2. The Gardener
3. The Peaceful Sage

One time I created in Anki card that I ask myself, what does each persona of purpose supply and what does each demand? I got to thinking about it tonight, finally, which was probably the reason for the Anki card to begin with. I don't think we need to list things like necessities. They should be things demanded and supplied in the wrong themselves. It assumes there is a human body to take care of. Sexual release is not considered a necessity.

- The Family Man demands sexual release.
- The Family Man supplies money.
- The Family Man supplies love.
- The Family Man supplies care.

- The Peaceful Sage demands time.
- The Peaceful Sage demands effort.
- The Peaceful Sage supplies wisdom.
 
- The Gardener supplies advice.
- The Gardener supplies kindness.
- The Gardener supplies help.

"Care" means taking care of others, providing them with food, healthcare, and a roof over their head. These things are provided by money, but money is only a means to the ultimate end of the Family Man: caring for his family.

The Peaceful Sage seems to be about acquiring knowledge and wisdom. This is the Buddha-wannabe persona. The Peaceful Sage also has worldly knowledge, practical knowledge. The Peaceful Sage knows how to get things done and the science behind it. He is always learning, studying, improving. He enjoys new insights. He enjoys learning about himself.

The Gardener plants seeds and waters them. The seeds are selected by the Peaceful Sage. The earth is his circle of family and friends. It is a set of individual people that can talk to each other, so ideas can spread in a network fashion. The Gardener may plant a seed in one person only to see it sprout in another, but not being sure if it was his cultivating that got them there. But maybe it was. Maybe the good idea spread.

## My Sayings

I really have some great sayings, I just don't always remember them, and I certainly don't live them all consistently, though I think I'm getting better all the time. 

> "I am at peace with all that has happened, is happening, and will happen."

Wouldn't that be great???

> "Substitute 'could' for 'should'." 

I got this one from someone else, I'm sure, but I saw the wisdom and added it as an Anki Card. 

> "Lock up the Judge and writing in a headlong rush."

I have a habit of editing while I am writing. I can seet that now. I have a strong pull to go back and fix something, when instead I should be "writing in a headlong rush" with The Judged locked away.

> "Meditation develops calm and insight."

This is pretty true, and I wonder why I don't meditate more often. I wonder if it is my mind pursuing since pleasures and so forth that interferes with me being able to meditate or being motivated to. My body is running the show.

> "Leaders develop subordinates."

I want to develop subordinates. I think I have a couple really good engineers, and I think I can help them be better engineers and better men.

> "Kindness, respect, truthfulness, timeliness, and wisdom."

For a while I was using these like a mantra. It's interesting that I don't think about them much. I was kind of surprised when I read the card, thinking, "Why haven't I said these recently?"

> "I forgive everyone who has hurt me and move forward with a cleansed soul."

This one is really Buddhist. What is the point of dwelling on the past, or brooding about the failures of others? Not to mention, the person that hurt me does not exist anymore! They have surely grown up and changed just as much as I have. I tend to have a conceit about myself, thinking that I am superior to others. 

I am probably superior to a lot of people, but not everybody, and besides, I think it's possible to have more wisdom than me. I am following the tracks of those that came before me, and even though they lead me in the right direction, I have to appreciate _why_ it was the right direction by looking for myself. I wish I could have a long, unbroken conversation with some of them. That would be heaven to me. God, if you're really there and listening, I want to be able to just interview the Buddha, Jesus, Thomas Jefferson, Karl Popper, and 19-year-old I descended from.

## 2021-12-14

Today I was talking to an outside attorney, and he was talking about how we should make sure we do not try to control the job site -- that our contractor, ACT, should control it. The idea is that they are independent contractors, and by directing them we incur liability. The lawyers want to be able to offer as a defense that the contractor was in charge of things. I had a bad gut feeling about this immediately. To me it feels like we are setting up to throw them under the bus. Mind you, they have been super good to work with the entire time. They have done everything we have asked them, all in good faith. I saw this lawyer's suggestion as bad faith. 

My engineer asked him if we should have a full-time security person on site. He said if he represented ACT, he would advise them to, but that he was not advising TECO to. WTF is that? The point to him seems to be not to protect the public from harm. The point is to protect the company from harm. I got righteously indignant, I suppose. I said something about my ethical code as an engineer, the first provision is always to protect the safety, health, and welfare of the public. He seemed to back-pedal a little after that, denying that we were "throwing them under the bus" as I had alluded to.

I did ask the company lawyer about it later. The lawyer that gave us the advice is corporate counsel. 

## Some Random Philosophy

Saying, "That could have been bad" is strange. It definitely gives me a negative feeling. It is like a little punishment for a sin.

"That could have been bad" seems to mean, roughly, "What I just did, had things been a little different, could have resulted in a loss of something." We can shorten that to, "What I did increases the potential to lose something I value." It adds to the probability of a loss.

Do behavior that add to the probability of a gain event.
Abstain from behavior that adds to the probability of a loss event.

Behaviors can be thoughtful or thoughtless. The thoughtless is unwholesome. The thoughtful is wholesome.

The brain is the subject, and the mind is the verb. 

The mind is what the brain does. If by mind you mean the conscious mind that is typing this, the mind is only one thing the brain does. It also controls the fingers. It has mechanisms ready to react to danger, idle most of the time. It's running low level operating system stuff. It's processing sensory input which cascades through the brain in all sorts of ways. It could be really, really interesting cascades of brain cell firing when you read this next word. Something that is not inside the brain gets shoved in, and it sets off a chain reaction of brain cell activity.

## COVID Booster Shot

Today I got "the jab." It was the Pfizer Covid booster shot. I got it at CVS pharmacy on Lumsden Road in Valrico Florida.

## Non-Self

The self is fictitious. It is a trick of the light. A brain feels like a self, for some reason. It's probably something to do with narratives. It's like the narrative style required a persistent object to represent the real, deep, ever-changing human animal.

## The Left Brain

## Cute Proof of No Good

Let $H$ be a hypothesis, a claim about the world. Let $e$ be evidence found in the world.

$$P(H|e) = \dfrac{P(e|H)P(H)}{P(e)}$$

![Posterior Probability](images/posterior-probability.png)

The probability of a hypothesis $H$, given evidence $e$ is equal to the probability of the evidence, given the hypothesis, multiplied by the probability of the hypothesis, all divided by the probability of the evidence.

Now here comes the cute part. Let $H$ be the claim, "There is an all-knowing, all-powerful, and good god, like the Christian God," and let the evidence $e$ be "There is incredibly horrible suffering all the time, all over the world."  Let's shorten it to "there is evil."

We don't know the prior probability of God, $P(H)$. But this won't matter, because it gets swamped by the other term.

The term $P(e|H)$ is called the _likelihood_. For me, the likelihood of god, given evil, is zero.

Evil definitely exists, so the probability of $e$ is 1. 

Now we can compute the posterior probability of god, $P(H|e)$ is zero. 

$$P(H|e) = \dfrac{0 \times P(H)}{1} = 0$$

Therefore:

| P1: If there is evil, there is no God.
| P2: There is evil.
| C:  Therefore, there is no God. (Modus ponens)

## Throttle of the Heart

Positive feelings move the throttle of the heart forward, and negative feelings move the throttle backward. Stillness is in the middle.

I call this a "simile" because feelings are _like_ a throttle.

## No Self, No Problem Reading

Language is a map. Categories are a map. And, like any map, the map is not the territory.

Pattern

A regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas.

The elements repeat in a predicable manner

Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure.

Language follows patterns. Our uses the subject verb object pattern: Joe ate fish. Another language might literally be Ate fish Joe but means the same thing as the English subject-verb-object pattern. Again, we have repeating elements whose repetition is governed by rules.

Patterns in time exist. Think of the sunrise-sunset pattern. We could think of it as patterns of events. The sunrise-sunset pattern may be one of the most ancient ones in our psyche. Weather patterns exist, where on a certain date in the year (event), we can likely expect a certain type of weather event. Managing patterns is about predicting the future. Predicting the future is about survival, at its most fundamental.  

Maybe differentiating was the first step toward intelligence. The first organism that could differentiate between light and dark would have gained a competitive advantage, say by optimizing its behavior for the amount of light. It gave it another degree of freedom. Whatever it could do before it could differentiate light and dark, it could still do. Those are its prior degrees of freedom. But after it could differentiate between light and dark, it gained the ability to think. It could now adjust its behavior based on the light present. It might be as simple as not to move when it's light and to move when it's dark. This would be the first nocturnal animal.

Maybe these are the three steps in intelligence:

1. Observe
1. Recognize pattern
1. Categorize
1. Form a claim
1. Act

Spelling relies on our ability to see patterns.

A picture represents patterns in reality. We may see a drawing of Angelina Jolie and recognize the pattern: the shape of her face, her cheekbones, her lips, her eyebrows, and everything else. But that pattern is just in our head. 

I recognize the concept Angelina Jolie when I see the painting. Angelina Jolie recognizes the concept of Angelina Jolie when she sees her own face in the mirror. Neither is more than a concept in the brain for a mere moment. It can be retrieved from memory but only lasts for a moment each time.

Intelligence is how much your pattern recognition hardware beats random luck. Random luck could be represented by a binary yes or no. This happens to be a binary digit or bit in information theory. So the intellect has added information to the system.

## John Madden

Apparently John Madden died today. I don't know how many hours of my life I spent listening to that man call NFL games, but it was a lot. Monday Night Football was my college roommate's and my religion. RIP John Madden. I texted my old roommate, Bassam, and said I bet Madden was already calling Red Grange games with Pat Summerall.

I also texted Shawn and Matt, because we all grew up with Madden, too. Well, Shawn and me more than Matt, but still.

## Angband

I started yet another Angband game tonight. This time I am trying as a high elf rogue named Shandalar. So far so good. Nothing special has happened, and I am only level 11 so far, but at least now I have Detect Monsters and Detect Objects.

After an accidental scroll of deep descent, I am deeper than I want to be. I'm having trouble even handling a few wolves. I got caught between a tiger and a panther, too. You know. I did kill the panther before I recalled it out of there for safety.

## iPhone Theft

Today we were supposed to receive an iPhone 13 by UPS. We got a box, but the box had only paperwork and an empty envelope in it. It was supposed to have an iPhone 13 in it. The box appears to have been tampered with. It has clear tape over top of the brown-striped UPS tape. I called UPS to inquire, and their central customer service told me they would have local customer service call me within one hour. It sure seems like the driver is implicated here. The driver probably cut open the package, removed the phone, and then fixed it with clear tape. The subject phone price is $800.00.

## Algebra Review

| If:
| $$a = b$$
| then:
| $$ac = bc$$
| and:
| $$\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$$

Definition of square root:
$$\sqrt{a}\sqrt{a} = a$$


Prove:
$$\sqrt{a^2b} = a\sqrt{b}$$

$$\sqrt{a^2b} = \sqrt{a^2}\sqrt{b}$$

By the definition of the square root:
$$\sqrt{a^2} = a$$

Square both sides of this equation:
$$(\sqrt{a^2})^2 = a^2$$

By the definition of square root, we see that squaring a square root term eliminates the root.

$$\sqrt{a}\sqrt{a} = a$$
$$(\sqrt{a})^2 = a$$

By this method we see $(\sqrt{a^2})^2 = a^2$ becomes:
$$a^2 = a^2$$

## Aftermath of a Fight

Tonight I made dinner for everyone. I had told Tommy the food was ready at least 5 minutes ago, and I noticed he had not moved, so I thought he had not heard me. I called out to him, "Tommy." He ignored me, intently looking at his screen. I paused. I called him again a little louder, "Tommy!" He came back with, "just a second," to which I said something to the effect, "No problem, I don't give a shit if you don't eat." I thought it was delivered in a lockerroom kind of ball-busting way, but Julie took offense and scolded me, told me I "wasn't helpful." I came back with a sarcastic "thanks for scolding me," and that was the end of all hope, because now she retored with a barrage of complaints about me and how sensitive I am. The old trope of me being overly sensitive was trotted out, and she made lots of "I can never say this" or "You always do that" analyses. She makes that claim often: that I am sensitive. Maybe it's the easiest way to shut me down from complaining, because if I complain she will feel her perceived inadequacy is true and hurt. Or she truly loves me and does not want me to hurt, and if I make it seem like I hurt _because of her_ she will feel it sharply. That second explanation is the more wholesome. The first explanation is made wholesome when you remind yourself that she grew up in a household that was awfully demanding and almost downright abusive to her. Abusive is probably a bit much, but at least an atmosphere of never meeting all the required standards, always being made to feel she fell short, never quite meeting whatever aesthetic standard her father had for her. She is like a burn victim that shies from a flame.

## Innate Social Emotions {#id2201231455}

#2201231455

The right brain seems to have built-in emotions of _gratitude_ and _compassion_ that make sense from the perspective of an evolved social animal.

Complaining
: The opposite of gratitude.
: Things should not be the way they are.
: Things should not have happened.

It seems as though complaining leads to anxiety and depression. It seems unskillful, unhelpful, and unwholesome.

## Right-Brain Buddha {#id2201231456}

#2201231456

> If you cannot control an emotion (like fear), then it is not part of your true nature.

Don't fight or suppress emotions. Notice and abide.

Maybe the Buddha's insight came from his right brain. He wants to teach us to use our right brain in a likewise manner, but to get us started he needs to use words: the discourses on the dharma, for example. All his words just prime our brains to make the same insight once we put ourselves in a position to make such insights -- meditation practice. 

## Form and Void {#id2201231131}

#2201231131

> A thing becomes something when it contrasts with its background.

The background is the void. The contrasting thing is form. So it might be okay to assert:

> Void is form.

And likewise

> Form is void.

Correlary:

> Without silence, sound is not possible.

The space between parts makes the difference. Letters on a page need space around them to function as a communciation tool and a context of other words around it to communicate meaning. The letters and words are form. The page is void. 

> Letters and words are form. The page is void.

About the right brain's big picture thinking we might say:

> The right brain sees the big picture: form and void together.

Another one is this, which seems to point to the idea of context. 

> A figure is determined by its bakground.

## Body and Mind in Competition {#id2201231457}

#2201231457

Maybe the body and mind are competing for supremacy. 

- The body feels. The mind is numb. 
- The mind predicts. The body senses.
- The way the mind feels is to induce the body to feel.
- The mind is embodied.

Stimulus leads to experience:

$$ \text{Stimulus} \rightarrow \text{Experience} $$

Also can be expressed:

$$ S \rightarrow E $$

The body is primary, because it stands between the stimulus and the experience of the stimulus in the mind.

$$ \text{Stimulus} \rightarrow \text{Body} \rightarrow \text{Experience} $$

$$ S \rightarrow B \rightarrow E $$

## Permutations Experiment {#id2201241740}

#2201241740

I added an Anki card for permutations a few days ago, and it said the members of our family (4 humans + 1 dog) taken in groups of 3 would yield 60 permutations. I tested this today using this Python code:

```python
from itertools import permutations

i = 0
for p in list(permutations(("Joe", "Julie", "Joey", "Tommy", "Maggie",),3)):
    print(f"{i+1}. {p}")
    i=i+1

print(f"{i} total permutations")
```

Here are the results, confirming my hypothesis.

# Zettlecasten Randomness {#id202201262208}
#202201262208

This code tries to randomize the creation of 90,000 zettel numbers per lifetime. I used it to simulate lifetimes. The results were best when I started with 10 billion and ended at 99,999,999,999. Randomizing over that size of numbers led to 25 straight lifetimes of creating 90,000 zettels without a duplicate within one lifetime.

> Random zettel ID should be from 10,000,000 to 99,999,999

You can do this a variety of ways.

1. "Hey Siri, generate a number from 10 billion to 100 billion."
1. `$ python 3 -m random

## Completeness {#id2201281810}

#2201281810 #math #logic

> In mathematical logic, a theory is complete if, for every closed formula in the theory's language, that formula or its negation is demonstrable. 

closed formula
: A closed formula has no free occurrences of any variable.
: A formula having only bound variables.

free variable
: A free variable is a notation (symbol) that specifies places in an expression where substitution may take place and is not a parameter of this or any container expression. 
: Some older books use the terms real variable and apparent variable for free variable and bound variable, respectively.
: The idea is related to a placeholder (a symbol that will later be replaced by some value), or a wildcard character that stands for an unspecified symbol.

In this formula, $k$ is bound and $n$ is a free variable. We can substitute anything for $n$, but $k$ gets values from 1 to 10 because of the summation notation.

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{10} f(k, n) $$

demonstrable
: Provable (I think).

## Joe's Zettel ID Format {#id2201292008}

#2201292008 #zettelkasten #tag #id #format

This is my final Zettel ID format I am going to adopt, starting today, January 29, 2022. It is a 2-digit year. Why keep writing the 2-0 in front of it for the rest of my life? I'm not going to see 2100. The next 4 digits are the 2-digit month and 2-digit day. The next four are the 24-hour clock time, down to the minute only. These zettels are going to be hand-made, so I'm not going to be cranking them out within a minute.

New Zettelkasten Format: `#YYMMDDHHMM`

For example, on Saturday, January 29, 2022 at 8:18 pm, the new zettel ID would be: `2201292018`.

## Find Replace with Regular Expression in VS Code {#id2201292010}

#2201292010 #regex #vscode

I used an interesting way to find and replace the Zettel IDs using VS Code. I wanted to find something of this format: 20220129201000 and snip off the first two digits (here 20) and the last two digits (here 00), leaving myself with 2201292010.

1. Opened the VS Code Search feature.

1. Clicked on the button to put it in RegEx mode.

1. Entered in the find box `(20)(2201\d{6})(\d{2})`

1. Entered in the replace box `$2`.

How does this work? 

It matches 20. Notice that the 20 is wrapped by parentheses, so it becomes a result. The `$0` result is the entire matched string, so the first parenthetical expression becomes the `$1` result.

The term `(2201\d{6})` matches the 2nd two digits of the year, the 2 digits of the month, and the 2 digits of the day, but excludes the seconds. The last term `(\d{2})` matches the last two digits.

The replace value of `$2` means it returns the part of each string matched by `(2201\d{6})`.

Running this on the string `20220129201000` results in these values:

- `$0 = 20220129201000`
- `$1 = 20`
- `$2 = 2201292010`
- `$3 = 00`

As you can see, the middle one is the one we want.

## Zettelkasten Database {#id2201301005}

#2201301005 #zettelkasten #database #ontology

![Zettelkasten Database Class Diagram](images/zettel-link-diagram.png)

### Zettel
| A zettel is analygous to a slip of paper.
| Each zettel has a unique 10-digit ID: `YYMMDDHHMM`
| Each zettel has a name or "slug".
| The body of a zettel is Markdown.

### Link
| A link is a connection between two zettels.
| A link has a reference to zettle A.
| A link has a referenze to zettel B.

### Pony ORM

```python
class Zettel(db.Entity):
    zid= Required(str)
    name = Required(str)
    body = Required(str)
    zettels = Set('Zettel')
```

This could not be more simple.

We would create a new zettel like this:

```python
>>> z1 = Zettel(name="Zettel", body="A slip of paper with an ID, name, and body (content) used as a way to record concepts")
>>> z2 = Zettel(name="Schema", body="A mental map or pattern of thought")
>>> z1.zettels.add(z2)  # Not sure about this syntax anyway
```

But this is not what I want. The link between two zettels needs a _reason_ attached to it. I would want to connect the idea of a zettelkasten with the idea of a schema, _because_ the idea of a zettlekasten _is_ a schema.

In keeping with the tradition of RDF, let's rename our Zettle class to Node and create a Property class.

```python
class Node(db.Entity):
    zid= Required(int)
    name = Required(str)
    body = Required(str)

class Property(db.Entity):
    owner = Required(Node)
    target = Required(Node)
    reason = Required(str)
```

Now all I need is a graph containing the nodes and properties.

```python
class Graph(db.Entity):
    nodes = Set(Node)
    properties = Set(Property)
```

### `__main__` for Pony ORM Zettelkasten Program

```python
# __main__.py

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Database initiation stuff goes here

    # Create two nodes
    n1 = Node(name="Python", body="The [Python Programming Language](https://python.org) is an interpreted computer language.")

    n2 = Node(name="Programming Language", body="A programming language is a set of symbols, syntax, and semantic rules that govern instructing a computer to do something.")

    # Add a property to link n1 to n2
    p1 = Property(owner=n1, target=n2, reason="is a")
```

### Simplification

```python
class Node(db.Entity):
    zid= Required(int)
    name = Required(str)
    body = Required(str)
    properties = Set('Property')

class Property(db.Entity):
    target = Required(Node)
    reason = Required(str)
```

## Separation of Journal from Zettelkasten

I'm going to try to split out entries from the journal into zettelkasten and remove journal entries from the `zettel.md` file. 

I've also been considering having a SQLite database with my zettels in them. This might turn out to be useful. It would be easy to have a Python script scan the `zettel.md` file and put new zettels into the database. The zettel ID would be the key for this to avoid duplication. Each zettel has a unique ID. The script would have to update the `zettel.db` if the zettel content or tags changed. The zettel ID would be immutable.

## Stick Shift Driving

Today I took Joey to a place called Cassels Road outside of town. We practiced stick shift. I had watched a Honda video the other day where they were teaching a teenage girl how to drive a stick. They had her start off repeatedly using only the clutch and no gas pedal at all. I did the same thing with Joey. On that desolate road, he probably started up 40 or 50 times and only stalled the engine thrice. It was a good day.

Once his left leg got tired, we drove to the Neighborhood Wal-Mart and bought some food for the rest of the week. Julie is playing piano on a cruise this week. I'm supposed to pick her up on Saturday morning, then drive her to some other town close to Miami so she can play a wedding. I'm supposed to help her set up.

## Long Week, No Rest

It all makes for a long week for me with no break. Sunday we will drive back to Tampa and Monday I work again. No rest.

I did the dishes again tonight. I did two loads of laundry yesterday. I also took Tommy to guitar lessons only to find out once we got there that the lesson was canceled, because the teacher is unavailable.

## Joke about a Donkey by Joseph Goldstein

I liked this joke told by Joseph Goldstein. The wording here came from a [website](https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/earthbeat/eco-catholic/nasruddin-and-his-donkey-tales-holy-fool), however.

> A neighbor who Nasruddin didn't like very much came over to his compound one day. The neighbor asked Nasruddin if he could borrow his donkey. Nasruddin not wanting to lend his donkey to the neighbor he didn't like told him, "I would love to loan you my donkey but only yesterday my brother came from the next town to use it to carry his wheat to the mill to be grounded. The donkey sadly is not here." The neighbor was disappointed. But he thanked Nasruddin and began to walk away. Just as he got a few steps away, Mullah Nasruddin's donkey, which was in the back of his compound all the time, let out a big bray. The neighbor turned to Nasruddin and said, "Mullah Sahib, I thought you told me that your donkey was not here. Mullah Nasruddin turned to the neighbor and said, "My friend, who are you going to believe? Me or the donkey?


## 2022-04-17

Today is Easter Sunday. We set up the hot plate thing on the kitchen table, and Julie got out a bunch of different little foods to cook. We woke up the kids around 11 am, but Joey said he was not hungry, so we let him go back to bed. Tommy participated in the meal. We gave a big can of wet dog food to Maggie, and she nosed it around the kitchen. Joey got to see her do that.

Therapy Session with Jaclyn Hall

Her phone number is 813-397-8099. She is a graduate of New York University (NYU) was trained by Dr. Walter Matweychuk who was a protege of Albert Ellis. He has a great website: <https://rebtdoctor.com/>

She said that she does not specialize in depression (Joey) and would recommend another practitioner to help him. 

Guidelines for communications:

1. She will ignore me in public unless I walk up and speak to her.
1. Any text messages should be strictly factual.
1. Except for abuse, murder, or suicide, she will maintain strict confidentiality.

My main issues:

1. Joey's depression.

1. Wanting better REBT skills.

1. Marriage relationship insecurity.

Irrational beliefs that are contributing to my disturbances about Joey.

1. I must be able to help Joey.

1. I did not bring Joey into the world to be unhappy.

Her initial recommendations:

1. Find meaning in the struggle. This is what Victor Frankl said.

1. Philosophy is useful to living well. I agree with this. Philosophy as a guide to living seems like something I can understand.

1. It would be better for me to let go of the idea that I am to blame for Joey being depressed.

1. It is okay to talk about my worst fears. I can imagine Joey homeless and addicted to heroin or something. What would that really be like? It would be a dark place in life, but need it disturb my entire life? No. It would be disappointing and frustrating but not the end of the world. Life would go on.

## Markdown Code Formatting {#id0216290122}

#0216290122

#python #markdown

OK, now it is today. Let us try some code formatting.

````markdown
```python
def the_truth():
    return "Joe Legner is cool."
```
````

```python
def the_truth():
    return "Joe Legner is cool."
```

How about a little math? Permutation of $n$ items taken $r$ ways:

```markdown
$$P(n, r) = \dfrac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$
```

$$P(n, r) = \dfrac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$

Brainstorm some ways this KB could be used:

- As a blog like these dated entries that creates searchable HTML file and PDF.

- As a set of pages on specific topics that get updated periodically.

## Convert a Text File to UTF-8 {#id0304290122}

#individuals #ontology

What if we stopped treating people as groups or even teams and started dealing with them as individuals? What if instead of credentials we sought skills?

Let's think of some skills. What about scheduling? There seem to be two skills involved in scheduling that are fairly tightly linked: (1) creating schedules with the Critical Path Method (CPM) and (2) using Primavera P6 software. One would think anyone having the 2nd skill would already have the first skill. I think at Tampa Electric there is reason to believe not many have a strong 1st skill: understanding CPM. We frequently see dead-end activities missing either a predecessor or successor or both.

## Calculus Made Easy {#id4611210520}

#4611210520

#math #calculus #books

I glanced over the beginning of the book _Calculus Made Easy_ by Silvanus P. Thompson (1918), and the introduction first got me laughing and then immediately made me realize this book might be great.

Link to the book:
<https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33283/33283-pdf.pdf>

The laugh came from this part:

> Considering how many fools can calculate, it is surprising that it should be thought either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to master the same tricks.

> Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics—and they are mostly clever fools—seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.

> Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.

The "Wow, this is good" came at this part:

> The preliminary terror, which chokes off most fifth-form boys from even attempting to learn how to calculate, can be abolished once for all by simply stating what is the meaning—in common-sense terms—of the two principal symbols that are used in calculating.

> These dreadful symbols are:

> (1) $d$ which merely means "a little bit of." Thus $dx$ means a little bit of $x$; or $du$ means a little bit of $u$.

> Ordinary mathematicians think it more polite to say "an element of," instead of "a little bit of." Just as you please. But you will find that these little bits (or elements) may be considered to be indefinitely small.

> (2) $\int$ which is merely a long S, and may be called (if you like) "the sum of." Thus $\int dx$ means the sum of all the little bits of $x$; or $\int dt$ means the sum of all the little bits of $t$. Ordinary mathematicians call this symbol "the integral of."

> Now any fool can see that if $x$ is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called $dx$, if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the $dx$’s, (which is the same thing as the _whole_ of $x$). The word "integral" simply means "the whole."

> If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may (if you like) think of it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.

## Images in the Journal {#id5011300122}

#5011300122

#journal #markdown

I created a subdirectory `images` under `journal` to put images. Here is an example of its use:

This Markdown input:

```markdown
![Anki Results](./images/anki_2020-05-22.png) Anki Results Today
```

Gives this output:

![Anki Results](./images/anki_2020-05-22.png) Anki Results Today

## Journal Script `newday.py` {#id5011230520}

#5011230520

#python #journal

I wrote a quick Python script to create a new Blog post entry every day. It will have to be run manually, but whatever.

```python
#!python3.8
import datetime
import os

JOURNAL_PATH = os.path.abspath("./journal")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Set up the filename and path
    today_iso8601 = datetime.date.today().isoformat()
    filename = today_iso8601 + ".md"
    path_filename = os.path.join(JOURNAL_PATH, filename)
    print(path_filename)

    # Create the file if it does not exist
    if os.path.exists(path_filename):
        print("File already exists. Exiting.")
    else:
        print("Creating file %s" % path_filename)
        f = open(path_filename, 'a')
        f.write("# %s\n" % today_iso8601)
        f.close()
        assert os.path.exists(path_filename)
        print("Done.")
```

What else did I do today? I ran shortly after I got up. Recently I've only been running 1 to 1-1/2 miles. Today I ran 1-1/2. The problem I've encountered is that my knee hurts. Whenever I start running and one of my knees hurt, I stop running. I don't chance it. But then I might rest for a few days, and the next time I try to run my knee feels perfectly fine.

I need new shoes, too.

For lunch Julie made "loose meat sandwiches" a la Maid Rite.

## Oh My Zsh {#id0112230520}

#0112230520

#zsh #shell

Today I installed <https://ohmyz.sh/> and a few plugins:

```bash
plugins=(
  autopep8
  brew
  django
  dotenv
  git
  heroku
  pipenv
  pyenv
  pylint
  python
)
```

I also installed the theme <https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme> but later switched it back to the original one, `robbyrussell`.

## Semantic Title {#id0212240520}

#0212240520

#semantic-title #writing

This idea came to me in May of 2020. If I have a date, link it to something with meaning rather than just stating it as a date. "Two days before my 48th birthday" has more meaning than April 1, 2021.

## Ideas for Computer Skills {#id0716290122}

#programming #development #skills #learning

Something I want to be is a Software Developer. To that end, I want to improve my abilities over time, even though I have not committed fully to this career change. So I have a Habitica goal to work for 15 minutes a day improving my skills.

For a few days in a row, I have not really thought up much to see, so I thought I could jot down a few ideas here to stir my imagination when I have another few free moments to look into something.

1. **Python Type Hints**. It think this might be a way to make Python safer. I should learn about it. There might be a Pycon presentation I could watch 15-20 minutes a day. I would need to keep track of where I was in the video or use bookmarks.

1. **Jupyter**. I learned a lot about this already. Maybe try doing something with it? Or maybe learn more? Or maybe set up a way to easily play around with them in the future like a perpetually running server?

1. **Design Patterns**. These might be worth memorizing, too. The ones for Python are probably best for me.

1. **Code Snippets**. Consider writing some code snippets for Python, Markdown.

1. **Javascript**. This also probably takes a course. I think I could pick it up quickly.

1. **Django**. I could always learn more about this. Some topics I am unclear about:

   A. Multi-tenant apps.

   B. Authentication.

   C. Generating and serving diagrams.

   D. Adding a Vue front end.

   E. Django REST Framework.

1. **Vue**. This probably deserves taking an entire course.

## A Definition of Project Management {#id0916290122}

#0916290122

#project-management

Here is an interesting if not lengthy definition of project management found in Kerzner (2017).

> Project management is the planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of company resources for a relatively short-term objective that has been established to complete specific goals and objectives. Furthermore, project management utilizes the systems approach to management by having functional personnel (the vertical hierarchy) assigned to a specific project (the horizontal hierarchy).

## Project Success {#id1116290122}

#1116290122

#project-management #objective #scope #schedule #budget

This is adapted from Kerzner (2017). A project should be considered successful if it achieves all of its objectives:

- within the allocated time period,

- within the budgeted cost,

- At the proper performance or specification level,

- with acceptance by the customer/user,

- with minimum or mutually agreed upon scope changes,

- without disturbing the main work flow of the organization; and,

- without changing the corporate culture.

Scope changes must be held to a minimum and those that are required must be approved by both the project manager and the customer/user.

## Excellence in Project Management {#id0312300122}

#0312300122

#project-management #excellence

From Kerzner (2017):

> Excellence in project management is defined as a continuous stream of successfully managed projects.

See [Project Success] for what it means to have a successfully managed project.

## Project Constraints {#id5011120222}

#5011120222

#project-management #constraint #planning #scope #schedule #budget #cost #quality

Again from Kerzner (2017):

> ...in Disneyland and Disneyworld, the project managers designing and building the attractions at the theme parks had six constraints: time, cost, scope, safety, aesthetic value, and quality.

Were I to adapt that to any of our projects, we would get:

1. Time

1. Cost

1. Scope

1. Safety

1. Quality

I deleted aesthetic value. What else could we substitute for it? How about operations value? How about business value? How about value to stakeholders? What about justification?

> At Disney, the last three constraints of safety, aesthetic value, and quality were considered locked-in constraints that could not be altered during trade-offs. All trade-offs were made on time, cost, and scope. Some constraints simply cannot change while others may have flexibility.

Which things would be sacrosanct? Certainly the last two: safety and quality. Right now quality does not seem to matter enough to worry about.

Constraints need not all be equal in importance. The most important constraint is the one we refuse to compromise by trade-offs. So this naturally excludes safety and quality, because we say we refuse trade-offs for them, too.

Could we ever have a trade-off between safety and quality? I don't think it's likely, because safety is probably subsumed by quality. Or if nothing else, they both point in the same general direction. We want the thing to be "good" and goodness by rights is going to include safety. High quality includes having a high degree of safety.

Let's take a stab at prioritizing our constraints as a general rule:

1. Safety
1. Business Value
1. Cost
1. Time
1. Quality
1. Scope

The way to think about these priorities is this: between any two ask yourself, "which of these would I not be willing to sacrifice to achieve the other?" Why did I order these this way?

In terms of a company that I would want to work for, I would want it to be one where we would never sacrifice safety for any other reason. Next is business value. The reason for _any_ project is to add business value: to reduce a risk or profit from an opportunity. So this must be second to safety, almost axiomatically.

The next four I am not as sure about. If they are not in a strict hierarchy, they seem to be _weighted_ in this order. Cost seems to be more important than time, generally speaking. Quality should be more important than cost and time, but I don't think it is for us. Scope should be subordinate to the others.

## Department Constraints {#id2016290122}

#2016290122

#management #constraint #resource

Could we adapt the project constraints to running the department?

1. **Requirements.** What is expected _of_ the department? What are we expected to contribute? How are we expected to behave? What functions do we perform for our customers?
1. **Stakeholders.** Who expects these things of our department? How do we know what they want? How do we make sure they approve of us?
1. **Communications.** What information should be passed around the department? What kind should be disseminated vertically or horizontally? Who does the communicating on various matters? What can I say?
1. **Resources.** What money, labor, skills, and equipment do we need to do whats required in a way that the stakeholders approve of?
1. **Constraints.** What forms the boundaries of what we are allowed to do? What limits our behaviors? What keeps us from doing certain actions? What is the right thing to when one comes in conflict with another?
   1. **Safety.** When faced with a decision, we should choose the option that has the greatest reduction in the probability of an injury.
   1. **Business Value.** We should only do things that have continued business justification: either capitalizing on an opportunity or reducing a risk.
   1. **Cost.** We should be cognizant of the costs of our decisions and work to minimize costs to the company in the long run.
   1. **Time.** We should try to do things as quickly as we can without sacrificing any other constraint.
   1. **Quality.** We should create things that are functional, durable, and reliable.
   1. **Scope.** We should maximize how much functionality we provide to our stakeholders.

## Results not Methods {#id1316290122}

#1316290122

#management #task #result #method

When delegating tasks, emphasize results, not methods. Provide suggestions on how to improve results. But do not dictate methods. This is easier on you and allows for people to distinguish themselves by their own initiative. You don't have to tell people how to do things. Just tell them what you want from their output. If it's not possible or needs more resources, they will tell you. Then you can decide if they are right and either provide the resources or alter your requirements.

The relationship at each level in the company hierarchy is like a contract. It requires that the lower level person provide certain contractually required services in return for a salary, benefits, and continued employment. What should this contract look like? I bet a collective bargaining agreement would be a good place to start.

As a department we could change our management philosophy to this. We first need to know what flows out of our department. This includes not only documents produced by us but demands put on the organization, such as money needed for our employees and operations. Once the outflows are identified, the directly affected stakeholders are identified. Next we talk to these stakeholders and find out what they want out of us. What are we doing well? What are we doing that's frustrating or counterproductive? Next set up sign-offs that connect stakeholder requirements to performance. The performance of a team member should be judged in terms of how much it provides value to our stakeholders, weighted according to the importance of the stakeholder.

The army requires leaders to receive training, education, and experience. I find it interesting how they split up training and education here. They are all related, right? Training is something like practicing to get better at skill. Education is learning to get better at a skill. Experience is the sum total of lessons learned executing a skill.

## Project Resources {#id0412250520}

#0412250520

#project-management #resource #employee #equipment #material

I am still reading Kerzner today. Here is his list of all resources:

1. Money
2. Employees
3. Equipment
4. Facilities
5. Materials
6. Information/technology

As Kerzner (2017) puts it:

> When we say that project managers control project resources, we really mean that they control those resources (which are temporarily loaned to them) _through line managers_. (his emphasis)

Another way Kerzner states them in the same book on page 14:

1. Capital
2. Materials
3. Equipment
4. Facilities
5. Information
6. Personnel

## Interface Management {#id5862930222}

#5862930222

The Project Manager role must manage these relationships:

- Within the project team
- Between the project team and the functional organizations
- Between the project team and senior management
- Between the project team and the customer’s organization, whether an internal or external organization

## Projects as Lead-ins to Leadership {#id5885920222}

#5885920222

> The project manager is actually a general manager and gets to know the total operation of the company. In fact, project managers get to know more about the total operation of a company than most executives. That is why _project management is often used as a training ground to prepare future general managers who will be capable of filling top management positions_.

## Line Manager and Project Manager {#id5867380222}

#5867380222

Line managers are the real authority. Project managers derive authority from them, "borrowing" the line manager's resources as it were. A line manager should never act as a project manager, because it creates a conflict of interest. It will appear that they are giving priority to their own project.

## Types of Employees in Kerzner {#id5895800222}

#5895800222

- Line Manager
  - Negotiates with PM to deliver deliverables
  - Manages Functional Employee commitments
- Project Manager
  - Negotiates with LM for Deliverables
- Functional Employee
  - Does the work
  - Works for LM
  - Formally reports to LM
  - Informally reports to PM

The **Functional Employee 

is expected to:

1. accept responsibility for accomplishing the assigned deliverables within the project’s constraints,
2. complete the work at the earliest possible time,
3. periodically inform both the project and line manager of the project’s status,
4. bring problems to the surface quickly for resolution; and,
5. share information with the rest of the project team.

## Governance {#id5893390222}

#5893390222

> Governance relates to decisions that define expectations, accountability, responsibility, the granting of power, or verifying performance. Governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, and processes and decision-making rights for a given area of responsibility. Governance enables efficient and effective decision making to take place.

## Project versus Corporate Governance {#id5860810222}

#5860810222

- **Alignment**: Corporate governance focuses on how well the portfolio of projects is aligned to and satisfies overall business objectives. Project governance focuses on ways to keep a project on track.

- **Direction**: Corporate governance provides strategic direction with a focus on how project success will satisfy corporate objectives. Project governance is more operation direction with decisions based upon the predefined parameters on project scope, time, cost, and functionality.

- **Dashboards**: Corporate governance dashboards are based upon financial, market- ing, and sales metrics. Project governance dashboards have operations metrics on time, cost, scope, quality, action items, risks, and deliverables.

- **Membership**: Corporate governance committees are composed of the seniormost levels of management. Project government membership may include some membership from middle management.

## Army Leader Attributes {#id5868390222}

#5868390222

The leader attributes are:

- Character

- Presence

- Intellect

## Collective Leaders {#id5894970222}

#5894970222

Collective leaders:

- Recognize that cohesive leadership has a greater impact than an individual leader has alone.

- Consciously contribute to unifying beliefs, attitudes, and actions up and down and across units.

- Concede personal power and control to subordinates, peers, and superiors when doing so will enhance a collective focus.

- Sacrifice self-interest and personal or unit accomplishments in favor of mutual goals.

- Create and groom relationships with others inside and outside the organization that contribute to advancing goals.

- Become aware of sources of expertise across a unit and draw on it when needed.

## Strengths and Limitations {#id5898500222}

#5898500222

Instead of saying strengths and weaknesses, say strengths and limitations.

## Coaching {#id5873320222}

#5873320222

When coaching, say things like, "OK, here's what I'm trying to do, and why what you did was not helpful." Or, "OK, what you did there was really good, because it aligns with something I'm trying to do. Let me explain it."

## Procedure Writing {#id5897770222}

#5897770222

Procedures should be written by the lowest possible level of the organization. Leadership should try to define what procedures are appropriate to write, in a certain order of priority, and should provide the tools and training necessary to write the procedure well.

We should start with our core processes.

## Garage Band Recording {#id5898970222}

#5898970222

Julie wanted to record her vocals singing I Wanna Dance with Somebody, so we got out GarageBand. I dragged over the backing audio tracks that her piano-playing friend Brandon sent over. I set the levels using myself as the sound source, and then handed the mic to Julie. She recorded her part in one take over top of the backing track. I exported it to a `wav` file and uploaded it to Google Drive.

## Morning Routine {#id5886600222}

#5886600222

I have been working at home for about 9 weeks. My daily work routine is as follows:

1. Start the coffee, either in the Keurig machine or coffee maker, but usually the Keurig.

1. Get up, get dressed, take my medications, brush my teeth, and apply Scalpicin to my ears.

1. Start a new Berry Remote Team Daily Report Word document, changing the date and report number.

1. Read and process the emails leftover from the previous day, especially the COVID-19 updates from the company. Include relevant things of interest in the report agenda news section.

## Project Planning {#id5872490222}

#5872490222

These are the items that Kerzner (2017) says the PM brings to the table during planning:

- Complete task definitions
- Resource requirement definitions (possibly skill levels)
- Major timetable milestones
- Definition of end-item quality and reliability requirements
- The basis for performance measurement
- Definition of project success

Looking at this list, it looks like the kinds of things the Project Lead should be doing in the early stages of the project.

## Deliverables {#id5876700222}

#5876700222

Rather than managing by phases or any other such thing, we could simply manage projects by deliverables. Here I am using deliverables in an intentionally comprehensive way. It means defining all the work in terms of deliverables. This means not only the construction work and the engineering packages used for construction. It also means all the little deliverables that are _necessary_ to the completion of the project.

## Improper Administrative Planning {#id5886640222}

#5886640222

Kerzner talks about administrative planning. This means planning the policies, procedures, rules, guidelines, and directives that define how projects are administered. It's the ground rules for projects. This part gave me a chuckle when I read it, because it so reminds me of my experience at TECO right now.

> Improper project administrative planning can create a situation that requires:
>
> - A continuous revision and/or establishment of company and/or project policies, procedures, and directives
> - A continuous shifting in organizational responsibility and possible unnecessary restructuring
> - A need for staff to acquire new knowledge and skills

## Methodology {#id5865920222}

#5865920222

<https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/making-project-methodology-fit-guide-6085>

> A methodology is an appropriate, professional, repeatable, standardized, and documented collection of processes, tools, techniques, and templates for managing projects (Whitaker, 2012). The methodology is what you use to deliver your projects; it should reflect the size, complexity, and industry of your projects. It should be based on good practices, such as those in the PMBOK® Guide—Fourth edition. It should be easily located and understood by all project team members. It should also be subject to the process of continuous improvement to make sure it is kept up to date with any changes.

Another great website:

## Design Patterns YouTube Video {#id5875410222}

#5875410222

Started watching this video which is over 3 hours long.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1FZ_Bd4DSM>

Patterns are discovered, not invented.

1. Idioms. These are the lowest-level patterns. They solve a particular problem in a particular language.

1. Design patterns. These are solutions to recurring problems that are usually language-independent but oriented to a particular paradigm. Paradigms include object-oriented programming and functional programming.

1. Architectural patterns. This is the highest-level pattern. The big picture of the system and how its components interact. This could be something to research.

## Indexing During Iteration {#id5880700222}

#5880700222

When we have a list or tuple and want to iterate over its members but also know the item number, how do we do it? Here's the right way (idiom) to do this:

```python
for index, value in enumerate(collection):
    print(index, value)
```

## Scope {#id5873760222}

#5873760222

A scope is a quantity. It is a mathematical set where the elements are all the work products in the project. The types of the work products are also elements in a set of project-specific deliverable _types_. Each type should be matched to a written standard. Then each member of the project-specific deliverables should be created with and judged against the written standard.


## Projects, Deliverables, and Standards {#id1415060222}

#1415060222

#project-management #deliverable

Let **department projects 

be the set of projects that are being worked on by department team members. Each project shall deliver at least one deliverable.

Let **scope 

be the entire set of deliverables (instances, not types) in the project.

Let **tasks 

be the actions needed to produce the items in the scope.

Let **activity 

be the intersection of a subset of tasks and a deliverable.

Let **activities 

be the set of activities.

Let **schedule 

be the intersection of the activities with the calendar.

Let **stakeholder register 

be the set of persons and groups that affects or is affected by the activities.

Let the **external scope 

be the intersection between the scope and the stakeholder register.

Let **project deliverable types 

be the set of different _kinds_ of deliverables in a project.

Let **deliverable types 

be the set of all possible types of deliverables.

Let **department standards 

be the set of standards that define each deliverable type in the deliverable types set.

Each project deliverable should include a reference back to its governing standard.

For each deliverable type in the deliverable types set there shall be one and only one department standard which defines the requirements for the deliverable. Each standard may define one or more deliverable types.

## Python Generator {#id5886350222}

#5886350222

This is a new concept I've not seen. Let's look at a list comprehension.

```python
g = [i * i for i in range(10)]
```

Running this will output `[0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]`. But if we instead put the expression in parentheses we get a _generator_.

```python
g = (i * i for i in range(10))
```

This thing is neat. What it does is meters out the elements using the `next()` function or the remaining items in the generator. For example:

```python
>>> g = (i * i for i in range(10))
>>> next(g) # first element
0
>>> next(g) # second element
1
>>> list(g) # remaining elements
[2, 4, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

## Organization of Blog Posts {#id5873890222}

#5873890222

Here is a proposed outline of my blog posts:

- A blurb about the day. Not a long dissertation, just enough to kind of tell the reader what kind of day it was with maybe enough facts to pinpoint it in time.

- A series of Level 2 (`##` in Markdown) sub-sections on topics of the day. These topics are purpose of the blog. I hope to benefit from searching, skimming, and reading them.

Today's entry follows this pattern. It starts with the blurb about me taking a Friday off and proceeds into the first Level 2 subject: [Organization of Blog Posts].

## Project Management Maturity Model {#id5870670222}

#5870670222

Here is a figure from Kerzner (2017). The green checks show where we are as of today, in my opinion. We have a ways to go.

![Project Management Maturity Model](images/pm-maturity-model.png)

## Project Management {#id5883970222}

#5883970222

Project management may be defined as the process of achieving project objectives through the traditional organizational structure and over the specialties of the individuals concerned. Project management is applicable for any ad hoc (unique, one-time, one-of-a- kind) undertaking concerned with a _specific end objective_.

In order to complete a task[^taskobj], a project manager must:

- Set objectives starting with the specific end objective

- Establish plans

- Organize resources including staffing

- Set up controls

- Issue directives

- Motivate personnel

- Apply innovation for alternative solutions

- Remain flexible

[^taskobj]: objective

## Maturity in Project Management {#id5882720222}

#5882720222

Here is a definition from Kerzner:

> Maturity in project management is the implementation of a standard methodology and accompanying processes such that there exists a high likelihood of repeated successes.

Notice the use of the word _methodology_.

> This definition is supported by the life-cycle phases shown in Table 2–1. Maturity implies that the proper foundation of tools, techniques, processes, and even culture, exists. when projects come to an end, there is usually a debriefing with senior management to discuss how well the methodology was used and to recommend changes. This debriefing looks at "key performance indicators," which are shared learning topics, and allows the organization to maximize what it does right and to correct what it did wrong.

Excellence for Kerzner seems to be the optimization of performance resulting from years of project management maturity.

> Organizations excellent in project management are those that create the environment in which there exists a continuous stream of successfully managed projects and where success is measured by what is in the best interest of both the company and the project (i.e., customer).

![Project Management Maturity and Excellence](images/maturity-excellence.png)

Our first objective should be maturity, then excellence.

## Python Type-Checking {#id5894670222}

#5894670222

From this video by Carl Meyer `@carljm`: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMgmKJyWKn8>

The point of type-checking Python is based upon these principles:

1. Reading code is work.

2. Adding code for type-checking is work.

3. Skimming type definitions is _less work_ than reading code. (#1)

4. Duck-typing requires you to read the code to figure out the contract between caller and function. "What does it walk like?"

5. Type-checking does not required you to read the code. You just skim the type definitions.

6. Code is written once and maintained indefinitely. There is a large asymmetry: maintenance happens more than writing.

7. We want to select the alternative with the minimum work:

   A. Rely upon traditional duck-typing.

   B. Include type-checking when written.

8. We should select option B - Type Checking, because of #3, #5, and #6.

### How to Type-Check in Python

Code without type checking:

```python
def square(x):
    return x*x
```

Add type-checking:

```python
def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x*x
```

The type checking code consists of the `: int` part after the variable `x` and the `-> int` notation. The first indicates that the argument `x` must be an integer. The other part indicates that the function will return an integer.

We will need a **static type-checker**. The most commonly used one is maintained by Dropbox and is called mypy. See <http://mypy-lang.org/>.

To initiate a variable as an empty list of strings:

```python
self.tags: List[str] = []
```

However, you should focus on type-annotating function signatures and only annotate variables if the type-checker asks you to do it.

### Union

A union is a way to let a function return more than one type.

```python
from typing import Union

def get_foo_or_bar(id: int) -> Union[Foo, Bar]:
    ...

def get_foo_or_none(id: int) -> Union[Foo, None]:
    ...
```

The second one is very common. It's so common that they made a separate type annotation for it called `Optional`.

```python
from typing import Optional

def get_foo_or_none(id: int) -> Optional[Foo]: # same as Union[Foo, None]
    ...
```

### Overload Decorator

However, you should _avoid_ using `Union` and `Optional` as return types. Instead you should use the `overload` decorator.

```python
from typing import Optional, overload

@overload
def get_foo(foo_id: None) -> None:
    pass

@overload
def get_foo(foo_id: Int) -> Foo:
    pass

def get_foo(foo_id: Optional[int]) -> Optional[Foo]:
    ...

```

### Generic Functions

Instead of the overload decorator, we can also define a `TypeVar` which consists of two or more different types. The way it works is this. If you annotate an argument and return value as the same `TypeVar` the type-checker will ensure that input and output is of the same type.

```python
from typing import TypeVar

AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)

def concat(a: AnyStr, b: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:
    return a + b

concat('foo', b'bar')                # typecheck error
reveal_type(concat('foo', 'barr'))   # str
reveal_type(concat(b'foo', b'bar'))  # bytes
```

Note that `AnyStr` happens to come pre-defined in `mypy` (I guess).

### Gradual Typing

Gradual typing is for when you have an existing code base and want to introduce type-checking. It operates based upon one simple rule: **type-check only annotated functions.**

### MonkeyType

MonkeyType is a Python system to detect types by watching a Python module run and then apply type annotations accordingly. Refer to its website.

## `fswatch` {#id3363400222}

#3363400222

I added a script to my KB project that watches two directories and calls the `make.sh` script when it detects a file change. The use case is to start the `fswatch` instance and then edit the `.md` source files. Every time I save with `CTRL+s` the `./make.sh` script will run.

It works! Here is my initial script code

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
echo Watching journal/ and pages/...
fswatch -0 ./journal ./pages | xargs -0 -I {} zsh make.sh

## Breakdown of a Project {#id5872910222}

#5872910222

From top to bottom:

- Program

- Project

- Sub-Project

- Work Package

- Task/Activity

## Project Charter {#id5872610222}

#5872610222

I looked at a book called _Project Management Basics - How to Manage Your Project with Checklists_ by Melanie McBride (2016). It taught me something right off the bat! It said this:

> According to the PMBOK, the project charter is solely owned by the project sponsor, and it specifically authorizes the project manager to utilize resources to execute the project.

What's this mean for TECO? Well, our support request form is the closest thing we have. I would rather have all business units use a common Project Initiation Form, but instead we will have to rely on the stations reaching out to OPM. That's the support request form. There's one thing that's missing though: change control.

We need a way to control changes to the Support Request Form (a/k/a Project Charter). We should have a versioning system. The first version that is submitted to us is Rev. 0. After that, any change is given a numerical revision increase. More than one text change can occur within one revision. A revision is just a set of changes all made at the same time. When a revision is published, there should not be any other outstanding changes.

I don't understand the PMI fixation on Project Charters. Here is a document that the Project Manager is supposed to be handed. But the PM is not involved at this point. Why bother to teach her what should go into a Project Charter? She cannot control what goes in it. It must be given to her. Instead we should broaden our definition and allow that a Project Charter is any written authorization to start a project. It could be a purchase order. It could be an email saying, "please start a project to produce a new X." It could be anything. I suppose it should be written, but apart from that who cares.

## Checklist {#id5889810222}

#5889810222

Let's try to do a checklist using Markdown and see how Pandoc handles it.

- [ ] This is a to-do item.
- [x] This is a completed to-do item.

The code for this is:

```
- [ ] This is a to-do item.
- [x] This is a completed to-do item.
```

I'm going to try this in my TECO team repository. Maybe I could invent a system of checklists to keep us out of trouble. I wonder what it looks like when we do the `.md` to `.docx` conversion.

## Categories of Project Failure {#id5885590222}

#5885590222

Kerzner (2017, p. 54) defines failure simply as "unmet expectations." I would re-phrase this as:

> Failure is the condition when performance is less than expected. $P < E$.

A _planning failure_ is when we set expectations that cannot be achieved.

$$\text{Planning Failure: }P < E_{unachievable}$$

An _actual failure_ is when performance is sub-standard, but the expectations were achievable.

$$\text{Actual Failure: }P < E_{achievable}$$

Let $\Delta_p = E_{unachievable} - P$ and $\Delta_a = E_{achievable} - P$.

The _perceived failure_ is the net sum of _actual failure_ and _planning failure_. The perceived failure will be unfair when expectations exceed what is achievable. It will be fair when the expectations and what is achievable are the same.

## Risk Management {#id5880320222}

#5880320222

Kerzner (2017) says **risk management 

is the key to avoiding planning errors:

> ...we believe that the major component of planning failure is inappropriate or inadequate risk management, or having a project management methodology that does not provide any guidance for risk management.

Section 2.9 of Kerzner gives a nice checklist of project failure causes. Use this as a checklist for developing our project delivery methodology.

## The Stage-Gate Process {#id5866800222}

#5866800222

Refer to Kerzner (2017, p. 60).

> When companies recognize the need to begin developing processes for project management, the starting point is normally the stage-gate process.

The process is composed of _stages_ and _gates_. A stage is a group of activities that can be run in series or parallel. At the end of each stage is a decision point: a gate that either allows the team to proceed or prevents them from proceeding until the work of the current stage is acceptable.

> A good corporate methodology for project management will provide checklists, forms, and guidelines to make sure that critical steps are not omitted.

But we should set it up so the Project Leads (a/k/a Project Manager in this context) are not the gatekeepers:

> Project managers are never allowed to function as their own gatekeepers. The gatekeepers are either individuals (i.e., sponsors) or groups of individuals designated by senior management and empowered to enforce the structured decision-making process.

## Checklists {#id5880510222}

#5880510222

A good checklist should focus on answering these questions (Kerzner 2017, p. 60):

- Where are we (i.e., time and cost)?
- Where will we end up (i.e., time and cost)?
- What are the present and future risks?
- What assistance is needed from management?

## Gatekeeper Decisions {#id5874870222}

#5874870222

- Proceed to the next gate based upon the original objectives
- Proceed to the next gate based upon revised objectives
- Delay making a gate decision until further information is obtained
- Cancel the project

## Lifecycle Phases {#id5897810222}

#5897810222

There are no agreed-upon standards for the lifecycle phases of a project or product.

![Life-Cycle Phase Definitions (Kerzner 2017)](images/life-cycle-phases.png)

In our OPM world:

![Life-Cycle Phase Definitions (Kerzner 2017)](images/life-cycle-phases-opm.png)

## Project Management Methodology {#id5895680222}

#5895680222

Achieving project management excellence, or maturity, is more likely with a repetitive process that can be used on each and every project. This repetitive process is referred to as the **project management methodology.**

> A project management methodology is a repetitive process used on each project and continually improved.

We should have two kinds of methodologies. We already do, sort of, because we do in fact manage these kinds of projects differently.

1. Projects that deliver what we set out to. This includes studies with well-defined outcomes. We could call these "closed-ended scope projects."

2. Projects where we don't know what we are going to deliver. This includes studies that are open-ended or exploratory. We could call these "open-ended scope projects."

## Project Changes {#id5887470222}

#5887470222

The way project changes should go is this:

1. The sponsor comes up with an idea to change a project requirement after the project has started.

2. OPM receives the change request and evaluates it.

3. OPM responds to the sponsor with a clear list of tradeoffs between making the change and not making the change.

4. The sponsor commits to the change or cancels it.

5. OPM documents the decision and proceeds as directed.

## Project Playbook Definition {#id5873410222}

#5873410222

The definition of the OPM Project Playbooks is "the enterprise project management methodology." Or, conversely, the name of the enterprise project management methodology is the Project Playbook. It is a repetitive process used on each project and continually improved.

Requirements of the playbook per Kerzner (2017, p. 70):

- Not too abstract and high level.

- Contains sufficient narratives to support the methodology.

- Functional and addresses all areas.

- Follows industry standards and best practices. Uses standard terminology.

- Is really integrated into the business processes.

- Uses standard project conventions and terminology.

- Has performance metrics.

- Are not too demanding from an administrative and bureaucratic perspective.

- Deviation should be acceptable when the assumptions have changed.

- The assumptions should be stated.

- Out of the box ideas should be encouraged.

- Allows value-added changes.

- Is tailored to the complexity and importance of the project.

- Not rushed. Enough time is spent on it to bring it down to the working level, not the abstract level.

- Considers bottlenecks and concerns of the user community. The user community to us is the three stations.

- Not too detailed.

- Does not take that long to use. Takes less time than we save by all the problems caused when we do not use it.

- Simple enough for our particular situation and clients.

- Has enough good metrics.

## Change Management Methodology {#id5870680222}

#5870680222

We should also have a Change Management Methodology.

Change should be managed by doing the following:

- Explaining the reasons for the change and soliciting feedback
- Explaining the desired outcomes and rationale
- Championing the change process
- Empowering the appropriate individuals to institutionalize the changes
- Investing in training necessary to support the changes

## Agile {#id5866570222}

#5866570222

Agile appears to be an iterative methodology to develop software. However, Kerzner (2017) seems to be talking about it as a general project management methodology. According to Kerzner (p. 77):

> Agile project management practices have demonstrated that project management tailoring can work. Most methodologies are made of forms, guidelines, templates, and checklists. The project manager then selects what is appropriate for a particular client and creates a flexible methodology or framework that can be unique for each client. we live in a world of adaptive environments. This is particularly important for external clients that would prefer that the framework be adapted to their business model and way of doing business rather than how your parent company does business. Framework success can lead to repeat business.

## Systems Approach {#id5898460222}

#5898460222

Kerzner (2017):

> The systems approach may be defined as a logical and disciplined process of problem solving. The word process indicates an active ongoing system that is fed by input from its parts. The systems approach:
>
> - Forces review of the relationship of the various subsystems
> - Is a dynamic process that integrates all activities into a meaningful total system
> - Systematically assembles and matches the parts of the system into a unified whole
> - Seeks an optimal solution or strategy in solving a problem

## Enterprise Project Management Methodology {#id5888890222}

#5888890222

Kerzner (2017) talks about Enterprise Project Management Methodology or EPM. In one of his case studies on pp. 86-87, he sets out in rough outline the steps that were taken.

1. Establish the number of life-cycle phases. They selected six. Others had recommended 10 or 12, but the time commitment for that many meetings was excessive.

2. Decide whether the methodology should be designed around rigid policies and procedures or the more informal route of forms, guidelines, checklists, and templates. They chose the informal approach.

3. See what could be salvaged from existing templates and checklists. The company had a few, but not all PMs used them. The PMs get to choose from among the tools available, which were all standardized in accordance with the _PMBOK Guide_.

4. Develop a means for capturing best practices using the EPM system.

5. Training.

## Reflecting {#id5879940222}

Every so often I should re-read these blog entries with a view toward:

1. Capturing action items

2. Transferring writing to other destinations

## Lean Project Management {#id5886890222}

#5886890222

Lean focuses on delivering more value with less waste. It does this by observing the following three principles:

- Muda – Remove everything that doesn’t add value to the customer
- Mura – Standardize for clarity
- Muri – Remove distractions and work at the optimal pace

For example, if you followed the lean project management methodology, you’d remove any unnecessary processes like revisions by focusing on the task at hand. You could standardize your project statements to streamline the process.

And finally, you’d reduce the number of projects you’re working on simultaneously to deliver higher quality work.

## Authority, Responsibility, and Accountability {#id0812020620}

#0812020620

#management #authority #responsibility #accountability #leadership

**Authority 

is the power granted to individuals (possibly by their position) so that they can make final decisions.

**Responsibility 

is the obligation incurred by individuals in their roles in the formal organization to effectively perform assignments.

**Accountability 

is being answerable for the satisfactory completion of a specific assignment. (Accountability = authority + responsibility)

## Matrix Organizational Form {#id0912020620}

![Project Management Compared to Project Engineering](images/pm-project-eng.png)

According to Kerzner (2017, p. 101), a weak project management organization is one where the line manager has more influence than does the project manager. This is _definitely_ the case at OPM and TECO.

But Kerzner adds that a PM with a stronger mastery of technical skills than line managers will make for a strong matrix structure. This is because front-line employees will look to the PM first, not the line managers.

## Stakeholder Identification Methods {#id1112020620}

#1112020620

#project-management #stakeholder

## Rapid Listing

Rapid listing
One of the quickest and most robust techniques for identifying stakeholders at the start is to:

- Gather the core team together.

- Clarify the meaning of ‘stakeholder’ on the change and why it is important that the team does not miss anyone.

- Get each individual to make a rapid personal list of everyone they can think of, giving them about three minutes to do this.

- Pair people off and ask them to compare their lists, adding new stakeholders as they occur to them.

- Move these pairs into groups of four and repeat the last step.

- Finally ask the whole team to make a joint list. This works well as a technique because it exploits the creativity of groups and word association.

## ISO 9001-2008 Quality Management Systems {#id1212300122}

#1212300122

#quality [#iso9000](#iso9000) #tqm

This is a standard that promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing, and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system (QMS), to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements.

In ISO 9001, **a process**:

1. is comprised of an activity or a set of linked activities,

1. uses resources,

1. is managed; and,

1. transforms inputs into outputs.

A **process approach 

is the application of a system of processes, together with the identification and interactions of these processes, and their management to produce the desired outcome.

What is important is to:

1. understand requirements,

1. meet requirements,

1. consider processes in terms of value added,

1. obtain results of performance using objective measurement; and,

1. continually improve based upon objective measurement.

This is essentially the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) methodology.

![Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)](images/pdca.png)

- Plan: establish the objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with customer requirements and the organization's policies.
- Do: implement the processes.
- Check: monitor and measure processes and product against policies, objectives and requirements for the product and report the results.
- Act: take actions to continually improve process performance.

> ...customers play a significant role in defining requirements as inputs.

This implies we need to know who our customers are and find out what they want.

ISO 9001:2008 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization:

> a) needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide product that meets customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and \
> b) aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for continual improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

## ISO 9001 Requirements {#id1312300122}

#1312300122

#quality [#iso9000](#iso9000) #organization #tqm

1. [ ] to ensure that changes and the current revision status of documents are identified,
1. [ ] to ensure that relevant versions of applicable documents are available at points of use,
1. [ ] to ensure that documents remain legible and readily identifiable,
1. [ ] to ensure that documents of external origin determined by the organization to be necessary for the planning and operation of the quality management system are identified and their distribution controlled, and
1. [ ] to prevent the unintended use of obsolete documents, and to apply suitable identification to them if they are retained for any purpose.

[^iso9001doccontrol]: Document control procedure for documents and records.
[^iso9001proc]: Management activities, provision of resources, product realization, measurement, analysis and improvement.

**Records 

established to provide evidence of conformity to requirements and of the effective operation of the quality management system shall be controlled.

The organization shall establish a **documented procedure**[^iso9001doccontrol] to define the controls needed for:

Here is another resource list from Kerzner (2017, p. 118):

- Time (schedule)
- Manpower
- Money
- Facilities
- Equipment
- Material
- Information/technology

## Project Manager Qualities {#id5866890222}

#5866890222

From Kerzner (2017, p. 120):

> These qualities can be split into characteristics and skills. Project manager’s characteristics will in many cases determine how they will deploy their skills. examples of the characteristics which help to form good leaders in construction project management are:
>
> - Integrity
> - Preferred leadership style (tending towards democratic)
> - Self-confidence
> - Ability to delegate and trust others
> - Ability to cope with stress decisiveness judgment
> - Consistency and stability
> - Personal motivation and dedications determination > - Positive thinking
> - Excellent health
> - Openness and the ability to hear what others say
> - Ease in social interactions with many types of people
>
> In terms of _skills_, the following are important:
>
> - Persuasive ability
> - Negotiation skills
> - Commercial expertise
> - Political awareness
> - Breadth of vision
> - Integrative skills
> - Ability to set clear objectives
> - Communication skills
> - Management of meetings
> - Early warning antennae
> - Skills of diplomacy
> - The skill of discriminating important information

According to Kerzner, managers must understand for employees to perform efficiently:

> - They must know what they are supposed to do.
> - They must have a clear understanding of authority and its limits.
> - They must know what their relationship with other people is.
> - They should know what constitutes a job well done in terms of specific results.
> - They should know where and when they are falling short.
> - They must be made aware of what can and should be done to correct unsatisfactory results
> - They must feel that their superior has an interest in them as individuals.
> - They must feel that their superior believes in them and wants them to succeed.

My boss struggles with all of these, to put it mildly.

## System Definition {#id5872630222}

#5872630222

This is taken from David Hoyle (2017) _ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook_, page 110:

> **A comprehensive definition of a system**\
> System – A recognizable whole which consists of a set of interdependent parts. More specifically:
>
> a) A system is an assembly of components connected together in an organized way;\
> b) The components are affected by being in the system, and the behavior of the system is changed if they leave;\
> c) This assembly of components does something;\
> d) This assembly as a whole has been identified by someone who is interested in it.

![Schematic Representation of the Elements a Single Process](images/iso9001process.png)

## Customer Satisfaction Definition {#id5878390222}

#5878390222

This comes from Hoyle (2017, p. 747):

> By combining definitions of the terms customer satisfaction and requirement , ISO 9000:2015 defines customer satisfaction as **the customer’s perception of the degree to which the customer's stated or implied needs or expectations have been fulfilled.**

## Steps to Measure Customer Satisfaction {#id5879810222}

#5879810222

### What Measures?

- Repeat orders: These data can be collected from the order processing process
- Competition: These data are more subjective and result from market research.
- Referrals: These data can be captured from sales personnel during the transaction or later follow-up calls.
- Demand: These data can be collected from sales trends.
- Effects of product transition: These data can be collected from sales trends following new product launch.
- Surveys: These data can be collected from survey reports.
- Focus meetings: These data can be collected from the meeting reports.
- Complaints: These data can be collected from complaints recorded by customers or by staff on speaking with customers.
- Compliments: These data can be collected from written compliments sent in by customers or by staff on speaking with customers.

### Using a Survey

1. Identify the customer’s requirements (needs and expectations).
2. Determine a representative sample of customers.
3. Determine which type of survey is appropriate.
4. Design the questionnaire.
5. Conduct the survey.
6. Analyze the data.
7. Present the results.
8. Take action on the results.

Several types of surveys can be used:

- Personal interview
- Telephone interview
- Self-completion questionnaires (Microsoft Forms)

## Today's Project Managers {#id2015060222}

#2015060222

#project-management #management #business

According to Kerzner (2017, p. 131):

> The primary skills needed to be an effective project manager in the twenty-first century are:
>
> - Knowledge of the business
> - Risk management
> - Integration skills
>
> The critical skill is risk management. however, to perform risk management effectively, a sound knowledge of the business is required.

Here _integration skills_ are roughly the ability to coordinate all aspects of the project: requirements, stakeholders, communications, resources, and constraints.

This implies a few things we should train our Project Leads:

- [ ] Business knowledge.
- [ ] Risk Management.

## Incompetent Personnel {#id5897350222}

#5897350222

Kerzner mentions three ways to handle incompetent personnel (on a project):

(#) On-the-spot appraisal, including identification of weaknesses, corrective action to be taken, and threat of punishment if not followed.

(#) Reassignment to less critical activities that suit their capabilities.

(#) Termination.

## Five Interperonsal Influences {#id5894980222}

#5894980222

This is adapted from Kerzner (2017, p. 152).

**Legitimate power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel perceive the project manager as being officially empowered to issue orders.

**Reward power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel perceive the project manager as capable of directly or indirectly dispensing valued organizational rewards (i.e., salary, promotion, bonus, future work assignments).

**Penalty power**: the ability to gain support because the project personnel perceive the project manager as capable of directly or indirectly dispensing penalties that they wish to avoid; usually derives from the same source as reward power, with one being a necessary condition for the other.

**Expert power**: the ability to gain support because personnel perceive the project manager as possessing special knowledge or expertise (that functional personnel consider as important).

**Referent power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel feel personally attracted to the project manager or their project.

## Project Orientation Checklist {#id5899810222}

#5899810222

A checklist for project kickoff or one-on-ones.

- [ ] What the objectives are for the project.
- [ ] Who will be involved and why.
- [ ] The importance of the project to the overall organization or work unit.
- [ ] Why the team member was selected and assigned to the project and what role that person will perform.
- [ ] What rewards might be forthcoming if the project is successfully completed.
- [ ] What problems and constraints are likely to be encountered.
- [ ] The rules of the road that will be followed in managing the project (e.g., regular status review meetings).
- [ ] What suggestions the team member has for achieving success.
- [ ] What the professional interests of the team member are.
- [ ] What challenge the project will present to individual members and the entire team.
- [ ] Why the team concept is so important to project management success and how it should work.

## Components of Leadership {#id5869460222}

The COVID-19 scare at work has passed, because the person's test result was negative. Sadly, false negative rates seem to be on the order of 20% according to some Googling.

## Udemy Course on Project Management {#id5864400222}

#5864400222

I signed up for a course called ["Deeply Practical Project Management"](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeply-practical-project-management/learn/lecture/7368204#overview).

I am taking notes in the `teco` repository under Articles.

## Shuffle from the Command Line {#id5898920222}

#5898920222

I figured out a fun trick using the `shuf` command. You can use the `-e` (echo) option and trail the command with a list of words and `shuf` will shuffle them. Say you have to do three things today, but you don't care where to start. Let's say the things are errands, dishes, and laundry. You can do this at the command line:

```zsh
$ shuf -e errands dishes laundry
```

The command will shuffle the three arguments randomly.

```zsh
dishes
errands
laundry
```

Items with spaces in them can be included by wrapping with quotation marks (single `' '` or double `" "`) like this example from Duolingo lesson names:

```zsh
$ shuf -e Traditions Social 'Memories 2'
Traditions
Memories 2
Social
```

You can also use the `head` command to filter the results to pick _only one_ of the arguments.

```zsh
$ shuf -e eeny meeny miny moe | head -n 1
eeny
```

You can even flip a coin this way, but the [`flip` Shell Script] is more fun.

```zsh
$ shuf -e heads tails | head -n 1
heads
```

## `flip` Shell Script {#id3382370222}

#3382370222

Today I wrote a shell script to flip a coin. It can also pick between any two arguments that you input. For example, if you could not decide if you wanted to go to the beach or the lake you could do this:

```zsh
$ flip beach lake
beach
```

Here is the initial code which I put in my `~/bin` directory.

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh

#5870550222

## If the user inputs two arguments, those two arguments {#id2666360222}

#2666360222
# become the "heads" and "tails" results. Otherwise we
## default to the words heads and tails respectively. {#id2680460222}

#2680460222
if [[ $1 && $2 ]];then
    heads=$1
    tails=$2
else
    heads="heads"
    tails="tails"
fi

## Do the flipping and echo the result. {#id2695910222}

#2695910222
FLIP=$(($(($RANDOM%10))%2))
if [ $FLIP -eq 1 ];then

```
## Voice Control and Dictation {#id5896710222}

#5896710222

[Here is a YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xalJD6V_M_4) on voice control.

OK, it turned out that Voice Control caused a severe slowdown of my computer. When I opened Activity Monitor, I found the speech detection using roughly 50% to 60% of my CPU constantly, compared with about 15% for the next highest. This made the machine infuriatingly slow. So, I disabled it. I can still use `F1` to dictate text if I feel like writing that way.

#1714060222

#terminal #mac #computer

Today I installed a new terminal on my Mac: iTerm2. It seems pretty cool. I based this decision on nothing at all. Here is the website that had the instructions I followed:

<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/>

Then I configured a Hotkey window and set it to `ALT+SPACE` using these instructions:

<https://www.howtogeek.com/337861/instantly-open-a-full-screen-terminal-on-your-mac-using-a-keyboard-shortcut/>

There is a lot more this thing can do. Maybe someday.

## Document Management Application {#id5876340222}

#5876340222

I once again decided to try finding software that I could use to organize my large collection of PDFs. Here's what I found.

- **Calibre 

- Seems clunky and dated looking.

- **Mendeley 

- I saw Elsevier's logo on the bottom-lefthand corner of the screen and walked away. Elsevier's business model is antithetical to my worldview.

- **Polar Bookshelf 

- This one looked so promising, and it had the University of Illinois logo on the front page. The problem is they have this paid cloud service, but the service's upper limit of 12GB is insufficient for me. I have something like 78GB of PDFs. Plus it would cost me around \$15 per month even for 12GB of storage. And they don't let you use Google Drive or Dropbox instead. I thought about using it locally, but when I opened the first few documents (`.epub` files) I got an error message. Not a good experience, so I shitcanned.

- **Zotero 

- I've tried this one before.

## Graph Theory PDFs {#id5898570222}

#5898570222

I found some graph theory PDFs and started making some Anki cards from them. I've always been interested in graph theory. It relates to some things I like such as CAD drawings and network diagrams including Gantt charts and even mind maps. I'd like to know the basics.

## Eisenhower Matrix Thoughts {#id5873330222}

#5873330222

Today I am concentrating on how to best utilize the Eisenhower Matrix for my personal productivity. I will limit to work-related thoughts. Non-work projects, chores, relationships, etc. may be dealt with some other day.

![Eisenhower Matrix](images/eisenhower-matrix.png){ width=50% }

## Daily Scheduled Tasks {#id5867360222}

#5867360222

I'm starting to think about the four buckets of the Eisenhower Matrix:

1. Do it now - for tasks that are both _important_ and _urgent_.

2. Schedule it for later - for tasks the are _important_ but not urgent.

3. Delegate it - for tasks that are not important but still _urgent_.

4. Eliminate it - for tasks that re either important nor urgent.

### Urgent

What is urgent? Here are some takes on it from the Internet:

> Urgent activities demand immediate attention, and are usually associated with achieving someone else's goals. They are often the ones we concentrate on and they demand attention because the consequences of not dealing with them are immediate.

This one makes an interesting point about urgent things being about _someone else's goals_. I guess what they mean is that my own goals will be properly planned, so they won't ever become urgent; that is, demanding immediate attention.

### Important

The word "important" needs to be expanded to "important to me." I cannot do every single thing. The intent of my new focus on the Eisenhower Matrix is to decide which tasks I should spend time doing.

It seems to me something is important if doing adds value:

- Moves a project forward
- Improves the organization
- Mitigates a risk
- Benefits a stakeholder (including me)

### Quadrant 1 - Do it Now ("Do")

What goes in this bucket? Here are some ideas.

1. An acute crisis, dispute, emergency. A chronic crisis or dispute goes in Quadrant 2.

1. A looming deadline that won't get done on time unless I work on it now.

1. Something requested of me last minute by someone in authority over me, but only if it is important. Otherwise, I should first ask them, "Is this important enough to delay the work I planned to do today?"

### Quadrant 2 - Schedule It ("Decide")

What goes in this quadrant?

1. Pre-planned project-related tasks.

1. Controlling activities for projects such as schedule reviews.

1. Providing purpose, direction, and motivation to team members.

1. Performance reviews, lessons learned, and soliciting feedback from superiors, customers, peers, and other stakeholders.

1. Project, team, and safety meetings.

1. Studying something I am committed to learning, such as Spanish (Duolingo) or Project Management (Udemy course).

1. Self-care including breaks, lunch, and exercise.

### Quadrant 3 - Delegate It ("Delegate")

Delegate stuff for which I have a comparative advantage. This means, if the opportunity cost of me doing it is higher than the opportunity cost of the delegatee, it makes sense to delegate. For example, I might be good at taking meeting minutes, but if it keeps me from doing engineering, it makes more sense to give it to an admin person.

1. Routing messages and instructions for the team.

1. Preparing agendas, submitting meeting minutes, saving to SharePoint site.

### Quadrant 4 - Eliminate It ("Delete")

Tasks that are triaged into this quadrant are time-wasters. They do not contribute to our goals. That's not to say they are entirely useless, because entertainment is important for mental health. But we are using this matrix for _productivity_.

What goes in this bucket? Here are some things that I would put here for me personally.

1. Mindless browsing of the Internet.

1. Learning trivia on WikiPedia.

## Tentative Eisenhower Matrix Workflow {#id5892990222}

#5892990222

### Receive New Request

1. Triage:

   A. Is it important? Does it advance a professional or personal project, objective, or goal?

   B. Is it urgent? Does it demand attention right now, or can it be scheduled?

### Start of Each Week

### Start of Each Day

## My Aspirations {#id5871960222}

#5871960222

What do I aspire to become? I do not want to stay static and just get along in life. I want to constantly improvement myself. The top of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is called _self-actualization_. It's something like achieving your full potential. I reckon if I build on my strengths, that will maximize my potential. What are my strengths, then?

**Strengths**

- Integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness
- Learning
- Cognition, analytic thinking, meta-cognition
- Problem-solving, decision-making
- Well-organized
- Communication
- Computer Skills
- Time Management
- Problem Solving
- Effective Listener
- Well Organized
- Bi-Lingual
- Musical talent

**Limitations**

- Fear, anxiety
- Self-control
- Impatient
- Does not take criticism well

My strengths lend themselves to a broad range of pursuits. It could be music. Right now I don't feel like music is the right area for my attention. We are not going to be able to play out anytime soon. And playing out is a lot of work for not that much reward, at least for me. I could do some writing or recording, I guess.

One thing that comes to mind is this: be ready to die.

I love learning. I love writing things like this journal. I love using computers, especially to get them to do something useful.

What do I love? I love a job well done. I love succeeding in obtaining objectives.

## My Statement of Purpose {#id5868960222}

#5868960222

My purpose is to be a self-aware, rational, caring, and wise leader of others.

## Daily Pattern Proposal {#id5899660222}

#5899660222

I am going to work on the taxes today. This should be my pattern for each day. I will write it in some basic pseudocode modeled after Python.

- Do morning routine:
  - Put in contacts
  - Brush teeth
  - Treat ears with Scalpicin
- If it is a work day:
  1. Process emails
  1. Collect urgent, important tasks (UI Tasks)
  1. Do the UI Tasks
  1. Review **Work Plan 

[Microsoft Planner](https://tasks.office.com)
  1. Prioritize non-urgent, important (NI) Tasks for the Day:
     - Consider due dates, energy level, resources at hand
  1. Do each NI Task (bulk of day should be this)
  - At lunchtime study Spanish, Duolingo, Anki and current course, book, paper
  - At end of day, process emails
  - Collect UI Tasks for the next workday
- Else (non-work day):
  1. Collect urgent, important tasks (UI Task)
     - Family problems
     - Upcoming deadlines (tax filing)
     - Problems around the house
  1. Do the UI Tasks
  1. Review **Personal Plan 

on [Microsoft Planner](https://tasks.office.com)
  1. Prioritize non-urgent, important (NI) Tasks for the Day:
     - Consider due dates, energy level, resources at hand
     - Consider how neglected the project has been
  1. Do each NI Task (spend an hour or so)
  - Sometime through the day do _Dailies_:
    - Study Spanish, Duolingo, Anki and current course, book, paper
    - Work on something for the kids
    - Process Gmail In Box
  - As desired:
    - Relax
    - Play
    - Read and explore new subjects
- Do bedtime routine:
  - Take out contacts
  - Floss

## Important and Not Important {#id5892490222}

#5892490222

Important
: I must attend to it personally.
: It _must_ get done.
: Doing it will move a project forward.

Not Important
: I can delegate it.
: It _should_ get done.
: No key objective hinges on it getting done.

## Open a Random File {#id5866590222}

#5866590222

This command will open a random file in the current directory:

```bash
open "$(find . -type f | shuf | head -n 1 | xargs)"
```

You can modify it to open, say, PDF files only.

```bash
open "$(find . -type f -iname '*.pdf' | shuf | head -n 1 | xargs)"
```

## Fireworks {#id5862990222}

#5862990222

Toward the late afternoon I dug down into the plastic storage bench we keep on the porch and took out a huge Ziplock bag containing fireworks leftover from last year. They included snap caps, about four Roman Candles, and gobs of bottle rockets. I turned one of the charcoal chimney lighters on its side, and we leaned bottle rockets against it and set them off. The entire neighborhood was alight with fireworks, and an eerie haze of smoke gave the world an unnatural aura.

## Resetting the Mac Mini 2014 {#id5897890222}

#5897890222

Today I erased the hard drive on the Mac Mini 2014 and reinstalled the macOS as a prelude to giving the machine to the kids to record music. I followed these instructions:

First I [started macOS in Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314).

Then I [erased the disk](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208496#erasedisk) and renamed the hard drive:

Hard Drive Name: `Apple HDD Legend Family`

After that I [reinstalled macOS from macOS Recovery](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904).
## Juran on Quality {#id5896570222}

#5896570222

Joseph Juran is a famous thinker about quality.

> Sense 1: "Quality" means those features of products which meet customer needs and thereby provide customer satisfaction. In this sense, the meaning of quality is oriented to income. The purpose of such higher quality is to provide greater customer satisfaction and, one hopes, to increase income. However, providing more and/or better quality features usually requires an investment and hence usually involves increases in costs. Higher quality in this sense usually "costs more."

But he gives a sense 2 of the word:

> Sense 2: "Quality" means freedom from deficiencies—freedom from errors that require doing work over again (rework) or that result in field failures, customer dissatisfaction, customer claims, and so on. In this sense, the meaning of quality is oriented to costs, and higher quality usually "costs less."

![Juran's Two Senses of Quality](images/juran-quality-defs.png)

## Requirements {#id5899600222}

#5899600222

Defining requirements is essential, but it must be done with care. We run the risk of (1) omitting requirements that are necessary to achieve the objective and (2) including requirements that go beyond what is necessary. Requirements that go beyond what is necessary for the agreed upon outcome should be the objectives of other projects.

We cannot remember every requirement. We must write them down, and then refer back to them at every step along the way. We can write them any of several places:

1. General to the organization
   1. Standards, including TEC Design Criteria
   1. Policies, processes, job aids, etc.
1. Specific to the project.
   1. Project Charter
   1. Project Plan

## Email to Band Director {#id5874770222}

#5874770222

We are supposed to send Tommy to drumline practice tomorrow at the high school. But we are not happy about it, because we are worried about COVID-19. It's a predicament. Either we send our kid and risk it, or he gets left behind on the drum squad. I drafted this email to Mr. Sever, but we have not sent it yet.

> Dear Mr. Sever,

> My wife and I are concerned that holding drumline practice now is too risky in light of recent trends in infections. It feels like you are expecting parents to subject their child to a small but real risk of a debilitating or even fatal disease in order to participate in band at a time when Florida is a hot spot for new infections.

> We carefully track the COVID-19 cases and deaths. The cases have spiked dramatically since the governor relaxed restrictions. It seems likely the deaths will increase in proportion, albeit delayed a few weeks.

> While the young generally seem less strongly affected by the disease, it's not always that way. There have been adolescents die from it in Florida in recent weeks.

> And the long-term effects are not yet understood. There seems to be some risk of permanent loss of taste. We would not want our son to lose his sense of taste at age 14 for the rest of his life. And worse can happen and does.

> I hope you will reconsider this decision and stop the practice, but at the very least, you should reassure parents who are (we think wisely) reluctant to send their children that there will be no retaliation for keeping their child safe at home.

> We are happy to discuss with you at your convenience by phone, text, or email.

She did not use my email and instead called him and asked him to call back. He did call back later in the evening. He seemed sympathetic, but used a couple phrases that gave us pause. He said something along the lines, "if this turns out to be as dangerous as they are saying" or something which led us both to decide he might not be as serious as us.

## Quality Assurance and Quality Control {#id5863810222}

#5863810222

Quality for a structural drawing means something like produces a structure that meets code and customer requirements as economically as possible.

## Best Practices in Quality Control and Assurance in Design {#id5865870222}

#5865870222

Here are some reading notes from _Best Practices in Quality Control and Assurance in Design_, NCHRP Project 20-68A, Scan 09-01.

The next several sections present the successful solutions that the scan team identified:

- Training and Communication Channels
- Review and Approval Processes Checklists, Manuals, and Standards Scoping and Environmental Quality Consultant Selection and Communication Construction
- Reviews and Feedback
- Quality in Existing Processes

Definitions:

Quality Assurance
: Actions to prevent defects or make improvements in the policies, procedures, and systematic actions established to ensure quality

Quality Control
: Actions to catch defects; the independent checking of work and use of control points (approvals) to ensure a high level of confidence that each product will meet expectations

## Partnering {#id5865780222}

#5865780222

What if we called our feedback loop system "partnering" as in we are partnering with the stations to benefit us both?

## Quality Improvement {#id5872960222}

#5872960222

Possible lessons learned process:

1. Read each lesson learned to a group of key stakeholders.
1. Describe what negative result occurred in as much detail as possible.
1. Ask the group, "Why did it happen?"
1. For each response, ask again "why?" until the root cause becomes clear.
1. Ask the group, "Can we start, stop, or change something we are doing to avoid this problem?"

## Red Lobster {#id5886850222}

#5886850222

We ordered a bunch of food from Red Lobster tonight. Is the first time since the COVID-19 epidemic that we have ordered from them. It was really good! We MBfgot a couple different fried shrimps, shrimp scampi, for baked potatoes, a fried fish, and green beans for something like 65 bucks plus tip.

Julie and I had an "appetizer" before we got the food, and I think I found out my tolerance is through the roof. It did not work very well for me.

Unfortunately we did not run tonight. Joey fell asleep at some ridiculously late hour, like 2 pm, so I did not want to wake him. I did knock twice around 6 pm, but he did not stir, so I left him alone.

## Dictation {#id5889870222}

#5889870222

I'm trying to use dictation more and more. The shortcut key is F1.

## `A->B` Thinking {#id2115060222}

#2115060222

#critical-thinking #logic

One aspect of intelligence is that it seems to be connected with word associations. It goes something like this.

1. I have a sensation of some kind: sight, sound, smell, taste, thought, or bodily sensation.

1. The sensation triggers the recall of an object from memory: another word, concept, idea, image, feeling. This is the `A->B` part.

1. Object recalled then triggers yet another word, concept, idea, image, feeling.

1. This continues until either:

   A. The idea is one of action, and you go do the action.

   B. You get distracted and snap out of the chain of thoughts.

   C. You become mindful of the runaway thoughts and snap out of it.

   D. You fall asleep.

Knowing all this, I wonder if I could not hack my brain by mindfully choosing which `A->B` connections are strengthened. I could do this strategically to get better, happier, more content, more loving, more generous, more caring, etc. I could make myself better this way.

I guess I am doing this right now, come to think of it. For example, a minute ago I was browsing a website looking for a Caltrans quality manual to read. But it dawned on me: I have been trying to "Stop collecting and start reading." The chain of events went like this:

1. I realized I was "collecting."

1. My Anki training kicked in and I thought of the mantra: "Stop collecting and start reading." This was my _trained_ response.

1. Then I realized that this was one of my `A->B` connections. This was an _untrained_ response. And in this case, it was an insight, not just a long useless chain of thoughts.

Maybe _intelligence_ when you are good at quickly making `A->B` connections but _wisdom_ is when you are good at making `A->B` connections that are helpful.

This sort of goes with the ideas of David Hume that I recently read. He says that ideas are either (1) matters of fact, or (2) relationships between ideas.

`Human Mind = {Impressions, Ideas}`

`Ideas = {Matters of Fact, Relations Between Ideas}`

`Relations of Ideas = {Resemblance, Contiguity in Time or Place, Cause and Effect}`

## Taxes {#id5883510222}

#5883510222

Today is the day we have to finish our taxes. The taxes are due in four days, and I am about half done with them. I need some more input from Julie to complete them. I will send her an email.

Here are some breadcrumbs for 2020 taxes.

- I found Form 1098 for mortgage interest on Grow Financial's website. I logged into the regular account, clicked on the mortgage, went to a summary page, clicked an **e-Docs 

link, clicked **My Docs 

and then scrolled down to find **Tax Document 

which was it.

- Form 5498-SA does not need to be entered. It is for information only.

- Form 1095-C does not need to be entered. It is for information only.

[Home Gym Project Plan](./gym.html)

`Key objective -> requirements -> solution definition -> WBS`

Let's do a project using the techniques taught in the Deeply practical project management course on you to Udemy.com. I will explain how we went about doing this on the journal. And the project plan will be given in the knowledge base pages section.

The project is a home gym that we want to put on our back porch. During the coronavirus pandemic, I have not been able to go to the gym. Joey also wants to start working out. So we decided we would install a simple home gym to allow us to do StrongLifts 5x5.

The first step is to create and agree upon an objective statement. This is a one-sentence statement of the desired final outcome.

## Anki Discovery {#id5887790222}

#5887790222

I discovered Anki decks can be put into a hierarchy, and when you study the top deck, you study all of them. So I put all the decks under Default and then renamed it to General.

![Anki Reorganized into Hierarchy](images/anki-hierarch.png)

It took me 20 minutes to study 141 cards today.

## Habit Builder {#id2683590222}

#2683590222

### Objective

To create a website available from anywhere that I can use to track and develop good habits self-actualize.

### Minimum Usefulness Requirements

1. You can view habits and add, delete, and edit them.
1. Habits have maturity levels that affect how often you are reminded.
1. You are periodically reminded to make sure you are doing your habits.
1. The system is automatically backed up on a recurring basis.
1. Enough documentation to maintain and improve it.

### Minimum Viable Product Requirements

1. Registration
1. Account management
1. Hosting (less than 10 dollars per month with SSH)
1. [habits.lovebirdapps.com](https://habits.lovebirdapps.com)

### Visualization

### Solution Thoughts

Each account has a set of habits. Each habit has a maturity level:

1. **New 

- Nag
1. **Developing 

- Remind.
1. **Strong 

- Check in only occasionally to check for lapses. Offer to increment. Lapses go back to Developing.

Desired habit frequency can be: (where $n\geq1$)

1. Every $n$ days
1. Every $n$ weeks
1. Every $n$ months

Appearance should be similar to <pinboard.in>: very sparse and spartan. Maybe I can just "plagarize" his front-end setup. The backend and the guts are the fun part, anyway.

The architecture will be a simple **front end 

and **back end 

setup.

### Set of Possible Features

1. Zen styling with calm photos

### Next Actions

- [_] Prepare a WBS of all the tangible deliverables.

## Deep Project Thinking {#id5867720222}

#5867720222

A good work breakdown structure is important. If it is done correctly, it identifies all the work needed to deliver the objective, and no more. This makes it incredibly easy to know what we should be working on now and what we will have to do later.

Productivity means making progress toward the completion of any item included in the work breakdown structure. The work breakdown structure in its totality _is_ the project. Delivering these things is how the project _achieves_ the objective.

The objective is always the state of the world we want at the end. An end deliverable, then, is something that needs to exist at the time the objective is achieved. An interim deliverable is something that needs to exist between now and the end date of the project.

We can imagine the day that the objective is met. We must visualize what is in the world that was not before: new equipment, platforms, steel, foundations, piling, electrical cables, and even OEM manuals, training materials, and properly recorded lessons learned. These are the _end deliverables_ to the customer: the one who requested and is paying for obtaining the objective.

The end of a project is defined as the date the last required end deliverable is turned over. With all deliverables delivered, by definition, the objective has been met.

## Joe's Evolutionary Development Methodology (JEDM) {#id2788650222}

#2788650222

1. Decide the next baby step needed to move the project forward.

2. Work to accomplish the baby step.

3. Record a breadcrumb explaining what you did to achieve the baby step.

4. Take a step back and think about the big picture objective.

5. Return to 1 above.

## Habits Website {#id5894990222}

#5894990222

I worked on the habits website and added a feature: it now records the yes and no responses and reports them. It's very simple right now, but it does something and keeps the data which is cool.

## Elevator Speech {#id5884830222}

#5884830222

I thought about using my elevator speech to talk about how the challenge team is like an executive team in a sandbox. But Rene said to speak from the heart, so here goes.

I love working from home for a slew of reasons, but I want to focus on one: My relationship with my two boys is flourishing because I am working from home. We are closer than ever before, and at the most critical time: their teenage years.

My younger son is 15 years old. He will only be living with us for maybe 5 to 7 more years. And I'm cherishing every day we have to together. He picked up the guitar his father before him, but he has a passion for it I never had. He has already surpassed me. Because I'm not at the plant, when I walk to get a cup of coffee, he is there. I can stop by and see what he is doing. He watches Youtube videos by guitar players and about guitar playing. We can talk about them - about what he is learning. We can talk about musical scales, styles, and techniques. I can see when he's frustrated or tired or angry or happy. While he is in the house, I do not want to go back. The roots of my heart are firmly planted here.

My older son just turned 17. He is a gamer and an artist. He is an emotional and deep thinker. He met a girl, and he is trying to better himself. He has been very sedentary his entire life, and although he is thin, he is not fit or strong. He's working to improve those things.

Because I am not exhausted from two hours in traffic every day, I have the energy to run with him in the evenings. We are about halfway through an eight week program to go from the couch to a 5K. He has stepped up and dedicated himself to it. He never resists when I remind him it's our running day. I'm proud of him.

Because of working from home, we ordered a weight bench and weights. Because I work from home, we will be able to work out together. I can teach him and learn from him.

Because I have 10 more hours a week not spent commuting, I am able to take him out driving two days a week to practice for his license. While I am driving I am coaching him, and we are learning about each other. I found out he is interested in philosophy like I am. I had no idea.

Working from home, my life has been enriched. At least as long as my boys are here, which is probably another 10 years, I do not want to go back to the old way.

> Postscript: I did not go with this speech.

I did not go with it. Here's why: the other people from the team that went before me played it straight and just did the usual, "Here's what I learned from this challenge..." thing. I did not want to grandstand and do my prepared speech. It would have seemed weird.

So instead, paraphrasing, I said this:

1. This experience was like executive leadership in a sandbox. We had a challenge and an objective. We didn't have enough time or information. But we had to make a decision. Yet it was like a sandbox, because we could not screw up anything.

2. The experience left me feeling like the company is in good hands. Not only do we have existing leadership that is conscientious about running the company and cares about its employees. We also have up and coming people like the challenge team that show the future is bright.

They seemed to really like it. Archie Collins, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) called me out by name a few times and messaged me privately. No telling if he messaged others, but I will take it either way. He specifically recalled the sandbox part and said something to the effect, "I'm sure many of you someday will be making real decisions that actually matter outside Joe's sandbox." What a gratifying experience the whole thing was.

I intend to ask Rene Gallant for some personal feedback before we move on. I'm also supposed to present the findings to my performance coach (Tom Berry) and director (Jack Prestwood). I need to schedule that tomorrow.

## Drove to the Hard Rock Casino {#id5874560222}

#5874560222

Today was supposed to be running day for Joe and me. Unfortunately, there was a big thunderstorm all over the area at the time we were supposed to run. So I asked him if we could switch driving tomorrow for running today, and he said OK.

We drove down 60 all the way to 301, turn right, and headed up north to I four. We got on I four for a short distance, and then exited to the Seminole Hard Rock casino. I took him around to the back of the casino, and we drove to the top of one of the parking garages. It was good practice for him. He also drove in very heavy rain the entire time. At one point, we hydroplaned a little bit. I think it was a good experience for him in his practice.

## Pizza {#id5898450222}

#5898450222

Julie had put a chicken dish on the menu, but the two chicken breast she got out from the freezer never really thought during the day. She was a little frustrated, so I said, do you want to do something else? She agreed. We talk to the kids and of course they wanted pizza. We ordered it from babes pizza. They now deliver.

## Changed Outlook Default Color {#id5883520222}

#5883520222

I reorganized my Outlook colors and categories to accord with my system of urgent / non-urgent, important / non-important based upon the following ground rules.

Most schedule activities are non-urgent. But they can be either important or not important. So we get three possible combinations on the calendar:

- Not urgent + Unimportant = colored GREEN on the calendar. This is my new Outlook default color. Most of my meetings fall into this category.

- Not urgent + Important = colored YELLOW on the calendar. Use sparingly for things I must attend to personally, things I am leading, etc.

- Urgent + Important = colored RED on the calendar. Use this rarely. Most urgent things should be done immediately. Only schedule something if it is going to take a long time to complete it.

## Zsh `$PROJECTS` Environment Variable {#id2215060222}

#2215060222

#zsh #shell

I added an environment variable called `$PROJECTS` to my `.zshenv` file. I can use it in paths. It points to my Google Drive projects folder.

```zsh
$ cd $PROJECTS
/Users/joelegner/Google Drive/Projects
```

## Zsh `p` Alias {#id2315060222}

#2315060222

#zsh #shell

I also added an alias `p` that changed the current directory to the path defined by the `$PROJECTS` environment variable.

## Axis and Allies {#id5896770222}

#5896770222

Joey, Tommy, and I continued our axis and Allies game today. It was a lot of fun. Tommy was just talk Talk Talk. Joey got distracted a few times with his phone, but that's OK. He has a girl now. I am playing United States, Russia, and Great Britain. Joey has a pretty good game plan in the far east. He placed a factory on the mainland, and now he has six armor they're ready to attack.

I was able to capture Western Europe with the British forces. I also captured French Indochina Burma, but Joey took it back later the same turn. When I got to the United States, I put a factory in China. I also reinforced Western Europe with a lot of planes, and to American infantry from Africa.

## My Definition of a Game {#id5871620222}

#5871620222

"A game is an activity that is governed by rules and does not have important consequences without your consent."

## SQLite GUI {#id2713060222}

#2713060222

#sqlite

I would love to have a nice SQLite interface that is more like Excel. The nice thing about Excel is that it is snappy and easy to enter information. This is in stark contrast to the SQLite command line interface (CLI). I searched for `sqlite` on the Mac App Store and here is what I found.

- **Valentina Studio**: 3.8 out of 5, 12 ratings. The ratings are from up to 6 years ago. Last release was 3 weeks ago. The pro version costs **200 dollars**.

- **SQLite Flow**: 4.1 out of 5, 12 ratings. The last rating was from May 29, and it was a good one. Seems to be a Chinese company which I do not like given their recent track record spying on people. The pro version costs **12 dollars**. But it's much cheaper than the SQLPRo line. (Update: Tried on 7/18 and hated it.)

- **Native SQLite Manager**: 4.8 out of 5, only 4 ratings. Light and dark mode available. Seems to have one developer named Krystian Kolodziej. Last updated 5 days ago. Seems to be **free**.

- **Liya**: 5.0 out of 5, only 7 ratings. It looks like I tried this one before. Looks like a one-man company. Appears to be **free**.

- **SQLPro for SQLite**: 4.5 out of 5 with 84 ratings. This is by far the highest number of ratings right now. It is listed as #36 in Developer Tools. The website looks professional and modern. It has a copyright mark dating back to 2012 by Hankinsoft Development, Inc. Seems to do light and dark mode. There are separate apps for the different databases as well as a SQLPro _Studio_ which seems to have all the popular ones. SQLPro for SQLite only is **40 dollars**. SQLPro Premium - Lifetime is **220 dollars**. One of their other products, SQLPro for MSSQL is listed as #18 free app under Developer Tools. The SQLPRO SQLite version is #21. (Update: tried and I did not like it. I thought it would have a tabular editor, but I could not use it because of feature limitations which is too bad.)

- **Splice**: 4.4 out of 5, 16 ratings. #57 Developer Tools. Pretty professional [website](https://glimpse.io/splice/). Seems to support most databases. The word "sqlite" only appears on two pages, and I don't see a screenshot with the word sqlite in it, but it seems to support it. It might even support MS Access .mdb files. Splice Unlimited costs **40 dollars 

after 2 weeks. Last update was 1 year ago which is a head-scratcher. (Update: tried and no thanks. I could not open or create a sqlite database.)

- **DB Browser**: Not on the App Store. Gave me this error: "DB Browser for SQLite.app can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software." Then I tried the previous version, and it worked. I've used it before. It seems tolerable, so I will keep it.

- **SQLite Studio**: Developer could not be verified, so Mac would not let me open it. This is probably a worthy safeguard, so I am not going to disable it to try this program.

I decided to try SQLiteFlow. No way. It's not a spreadsheet-like interface. To add a row requires me to click a `+` button every time. I uninstalled immediately.

Next I tried Splice, since it's only 40 dollars. Also nope.

Okay, okay, I will try SQLPro Studio. It's expensive, but let's see if it is worth it the way Excel is worth it. Aaaaaand it was not worth it. Forget it.

## DB Browser {#id5866660222}

#5866660222

I ended up installing a program called [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org). It is free and open source and is close enough to what I wanted. I'm content.

## Fidelity Re-balancing {#id5875440222}

#5875440222

Today I re-balanced my Fidelity rollover to 80/20 split between stocks and bonds by the following steps.

1. Logged into Fidelity account.
1. Researched and found `FUAMX` bond fund which has an extremely low expense ratio of 0.03.
1. Looked on the Analysis tab to see how much I had. The split was 90/10.
1. Calculated how much stock I needed to sell to purchase bonds to get back to 80/20. It was 12,000 dollars.
1. Sold 2,400 dollars of `FNCMX` to buy `FUAMX`.
1. Sold 4,800 dollars of `FSKAX` to buy `FUAMX`.
1. Sold 4,800 dollars of `FXAIX` to buy `FUAMX`.

The whole event including writing this journal entry took about 10 minutes.

## Refrigerator Not Working {#id5873860222}

#5873860222

Back in May we had the refrigerator repaired. Today Julie realize that the temperature was really high. She measured 60° inside the fridge. The freezer is working just fine, which means it is the fan that blows the cold air into the fridge that's the problem. Since the repair technician cannot come until Monday, we moved critical items into the old beverage fridge. That old fridge is a trooper and never fails us.

## Hot Dogs for Lunch {#id5864330222}

#5864330222

We had a hotdog feast for lunch. I grilled them on the gas grill. We heated up a can of steak 'n Shake chili that we had in the cupboard. Then we had out diced onions, a bunch of different kinds of mustard, cheese, pickled jalapeños, and ketchup.

## Set up Music Workstation {#id5897590222}

#5897590222

I put together the new desk and set up the Mac Mini 2014 today. It's awesome! Tommy messed around with his guitar and different amp sounds. He was having a great time. Everything seems to work, except I have not yet hooked up the Korg keyboard to do midi.

![Tommy at the Music Workstation](images/Tommy-workstation.jpg)

## Run with Joey {#id5876750222}

#5876750222

Since we got rained out the other day and switched with driving, we decided to skip Friday for rest and run on Saturday.

## Apple Support Community {#id5893770222}

#5893770222

I created user name `JoeLegendSr` for Apple Support Communities.

## Mindfulness of Thoughts {#id5872360222}

#5872360222

I seem to detect three broad kinds of thoughts:

- Planning
- Remembering
- Fantasizing

The first kind includes thinking about what I need to do today, what could go wrong, what I might gain by a decision, etc. The second kind includes hearing songs in my head, thinking about past events or people, recalling information that I need now or in the future, etc. The third kind is the most interesting. It often involves thoughts about an alternate universe where some aspect of my life is different than it is now.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be someone else, especially when I think about events like the Holocaust. This I guess falls into the fantasizing category, but also into the remembering category.

## Duolingo Acing a Skill {#id5863400222}

#5863400222

Today I got an interesting message while doing Info. 2 lesson. I took them up on it.

![Duolingo Acing this Skill Message](images/duolingo-acing-skill.png)

## Tommy Geometry {#id5889990222}

#5889990222

Tommy got 100 on his two final exams in Geometry! He finished the class with a solid B grade (~83 I think). This is amazing considering how fully he loathed geometry early on. We had some serious familial clashes over it. Eventually I intervened and helped him. I taught him the famous `SOHCAHTOA` which got him through a bunch of lessons and problems on the final. When we got to the part where he had to complete the square (something I never quite understood), Julie helped him instead, and he was successful with that too.

## Useless Math Problem about Probability {#id5871600222}

#5871600222

I have a strange idea to solve a useless math problem: how many rolls of snake eyes is closest to a one-in-a-million chance?

The probability of rolling snake eyes is $1/36 \approx 0.0278$. The probability of rolling $k$ snake eyes is then:

$$Pr(x=k) = (1/36)^k$$

Setting this equal to 1/1000000 give us:

$$(1/36)^{k} = (1/1000000)$$

Recognizing that if we solve $b^k = x$ for $k$ we get $k = \log_b x$ we can solve for $k$:

$$k = \log_{(1/36)} (1/1000000)$$

$$k = 3.855291627 \text{ (rolls of snake eyes in a row)}$$

This is a surprising result for me: less than 4 rolls!? Let's check our work with a calculator.

When I enter `(1/36)^(3.855291627) = 0.999900000099999` which is an error of -0.060000000061495. It's correct!

Since we cannot roll the dice 0.855 times, we need to round up or down. The error of the two values 3 and 4 are 20.433 and -0.405 respectively therefore the answer we get is:

$$\boxed{k = 4 \text{ rolls of snake eyes}}$$

The probability is about 1 in 1,680,000 to roll 4 snake eyes in a row. Surprising to me.

Now let's see how many _individual dice_ you would have to roll 1s on, $k$, to get a 1 in 1,000,000 chance, shall we? The probability of a success is $5/6 \approx 0.833$.

$$k = \log_{1/6}{(1/1000000)} = 7.7105833$$

Testing this result with a calculator, I get `(1/6)^(7.7105833) = 0.999900000099917` which is an error of -0.300800000082427. It's correct!

Rolling 7 dice gives you a probability of 0.225703000045085 or about 1/279935. Rolling 8 dice gives you a probability of 0.535900000074181 or about 1/1679616 (1 in 1.68 million).

$$\boxed{\text{Rolling 1s on 8 dice}}$$

The probability seems to be the same: 1 in 1,680,000. But is this a surprise? No. 

In the first experiment, there is only one event _E_ in the sample space _S_ that corresponds to success: 4 rolls of snakeyes which is 8 6's. In the second experiement, there is only one event in the sample space that corresponds to success: also 8 rolls of 6.

To get to a perfect 1 in 1,000,000 chance, we need a sample space with exactly 1,000,000 possible experiement outcomes with only one of them being considered a success. Dice are not good for this, because 6 is not a divisor of 1,000,000. But I want it to be something handy around the house. Sure I could use my phone, but what's the fun in that. It should be a physical object doing the randomizing.

We are off to a good start already because:

$$2^{20} = 1048576$$

The error of this value is only 4.86 percent. So we have a fun answer:

> Getting heads on a fair coin 20 times in a row is approximately equal to 1 microprobability.

How can we use this to imagine what small probabilities are? Let's talk micromorts. A micromort is a 1 in a million chance of death. Living in an industrial country for 1 day at age 20 is about a micromort. Skydiving is about 10 micromorts. 

Suppose we take the 1 in a million chance. We will arbitrarily take heads to be good and tails to be bad. If we flip tails 20 times in a row, we die. If we roll heads even _one_ time along the way to 20, we live. That's pretty much the same chance as 1 micromort.

[Driving is 2 micromorts per hour](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/sites/default/files/images/staff/Bruce/Micromorts_0.png). The risk of death for me at age 47 per day is about 6 micromorts according to [this website](https://charlesfudgemuffin.blogspot.com/2017/01/micromorts-risk-of-dying.html) (for Julie it's 4 micromorts per day). So if I drive for 3 hours, that alone would double my chance of dying that day. Interesting.

Suppose we want to simulate what 1 micromort is like. We can play this game.

Flip a coin until either (1) you flip a single heads or (2) you flip 20 times. If you flip a heads, you live. If you flip 20 tails in a row, however, you die. This experiment should go rather quickly, because you should flip a heads on or before the fifth flip about 97 percent of the time. At 5 seconds per flip, that is 25 seconds for the experiment. Getting to 20 flips is daunting. But this is what a 1 in 1,000,000 chance really feels like.

Here's another fun one. According to [this website](https://www.thrillist.com/cars/nation/how-likely-you-are-to-die-in-a-car-accident-in-every-us-state-the-most-dangerous-roads-in-america), the chance of dying in a car crash in Florida is 1 in 8,123 per year. Using our coin-flipping, this is equivalent to flipping thirteen tails in a row, because $2^{13} = 8192 \approx 8123$.

#5888610222

We could not do our runs tonight because of thunderstorms. The storms started around 5 pm or so and continued until after dark at 8:30 pm.

## AHP Example {#id5871380222}

#5871380222

I'm trying to use the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to make a decision. The decision is about what software side project to undertake. Here is my first draft of the AHP diagram:

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example01.png)

Next I used the [AHP-OS AHP calculator](https://bpmsg.com/ahp/ahp-calc.php?n=4&t=AHP+priorities&c[0]=Reasonable+Size&c[1]=Fun&c[2]=Time+Saver&c[3]=Career+Benefit) to assign priorities to the criteria.

## Theft of Squat Rack {#id5881840222}

#5881840222

Since I cannot work out at the office anymore, I ordered a bunch of weight equipment from Amazon. Today I went on my phone to see the status of those deliveries, because many of them were delayed. Lots of people are making home Jens during coronavirus pandemic. Lo and behold, one of the packages was supposed to have been delivered on Saturday, July 25. Sadly, we did not receive it. We think it was stolen.

If you recall, that was the day that Julie and I went to Hillsboro River Park and went hiking. The kids, as usual, we're sleeping in until the late afternoon, and did not hear the delivery. There was also evidence in the neighborhood that someone had tampered with mailboxes.

I reported the theft to the seller. I also reported it to Amazon, but they said the delivery was the responsibility of the seller in this case. As of right now I have a little hope that this will be resolved in our favor. But perhaps, since we paid with a visa, it will be.

## GTK {#id5896370222}

#5896370222

GTK is the Gnome graphics toolkit. It's apparently possible to use it on a Mac with Python by installing something called PyGObject. I tried today, and I kept getting installation errors. The documentation was lousy. I gave up after about 15 minutes of trying.

If I do a GUI someday, I will probably make it using Qt. It seems to be way more well thought out, maybe because it is commercial.

## Software Decision {#id5897880222}

#5897880222

Let's continue with my software decision making using a AHP. Recall that I got this far yesterday:

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example01.png)

Let's rearrange the level of alternatives:

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example03.png)

Now I have 16 different pairwise comparisons to make starting with the comparison of the four alternatives under "Reasonable Scale."

The results under **Reasonable Scale**:

- Project Management: 0.06.
- Decision Making: 0.54.
- OKRs: 0.23.
- Habits: 0.17.

The results under **Fun**:

- Project Management: 0.13.
- Decision Making: 0.52.
- OKRs: 0.12.
- Habits: 0.24.

The results under **Time-Saving**:

- Project Management: 0.65.
- Decision Making: 0.09.
- OKRs: 0.17.
- Habits: 0.09.

The results under **Career Benefit**:

- Project Management: 0.19.
- Decision Making: 0.37.
- OKRs: 0.37.
- Habits: 0.07.

Now for the fun part, using the weights to calculate the priorities of the different options. I will simply used Excel for this part.

Drum roll please!

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example04.png)

The winner: **Decision-making software**!

Runner-up: OKR software.

## Decisions Project {#id5865470222}

#5865470222

Holy cow, I started my [Decisions App](https://github.com/joelgner/decisions) and already have some traction going. This is exciting. I got the skeleton of the project worked out. The next baby step is to start the file with `__main__()` in it. I should probably read a GTK tutorial before I take this step.

> Next Baby Step: Watch an introductory video to figure out how the `__main__()` function should work.

I made a lot of progress on the decisions app today. I was able to create a model using SQLAlchemy to save to a sqlite database.

## DecisionManager {#id5875670222}

#5875670222

I am contemplating a class called decision manager that will do the work of creating a new decision, we are loading one from an existing file. It will also have to be able to copy a temporary file to the new location when we do a save as.

## Acceptable Practice {#id5863720222}

#5863720222

I found this figure in Reliability of Structures by Nowak and Collins (2000) and found it fascinating.

![Acceptable Practice](images/acceptable-practice.png)

I can say in all honesty that I only worry about two of the error types:

- Error of concept, where I don't notice that I am ignorant of something and,

- Error of execution, where I make a mistake in calculations or something.

I am simply too conscientious to make the other errors.

![A Fault Tree for Concrete](images/fault-tree.png)

## New Concept of Success {#id5890320222}

#5890320222

In the following, I will use system to represent an organization.

What if the system's success was measured as the sum of the opinions of its stakeholders? Or more rightly, maybe it should be the degree to which the stakeholder's opinion is positive. It should be weighted by the influence that the stakeholder's satisfaction or dissatisfaction has over the continued operation of the system.

Each stakeholder demands one or more things from the system. The shareholders demand return on investment. Or perhaps they demand the feeling of certainty that there will be future return on investment. Employees demand as high of pay as possible, confidence in their own safety, job security, personal fulfillment, enjoyment of time spent at work.

But let's think about the word reliable. If something is reliable, you can count on the fact that its capacity will be there when demanded. It's even easier than that. A person _expects_ that everything will fail at some point. After all, they expect to die, so they expect that their demand to continue living will not be supplied by their own body in the future. So humans are okay with failure, just - not too soon.

If they buy a car, they do not think it was a bad purchase if the car lasts 12 years. But if it's irreparably inoperable within 4 months, they will want their money back.

Now we can go back to our thoughts about reliability and update them. Something is reliable if supply meets or exceeds demand for at least as long as the stakeholder expects. It does so efficiently if it just _barely_ meets demand the entire time. That's too much to hope for, but we can say that we want to minimize the gap between demand and supply as long as supply remains on top. Why is this? It's because supply costs money. Or more rightly, supply consumes resources. Because money is exchanged for goods and services. Resources, then, are just the goods and services.

I think the right way to think about the success of a system is this:

> Is the system capable of suppling enough for all the demands on it sufficiently to continue to survive?

If it does not meet demand, it will die. Here die can mean different things for different systems. For a living system, the word die is obvious. For a business, it means to go out of business. For a machine, it means get thrown away. For a machine _design_ it means continued to be actively used.

Maybe this is what the viability axiom is about. A system fails to be a system if it dies. It's not a dead system -- it is not a system at all. Maybe this is what really defines a system.

**A system is a set of components that interact to supply the demand of one or more stakeholders well enough in the opinion of a stakeholder for the stakeholder to keep it in their service.**

By this definition, once it is destroyed or disposed of, it ceases to be a system. I think this is OK. It's like saying a living thing is no longer that thing after it dies. Thus a system is a living thing. A living thing is a system.

A natural system is the same thing, except without a stakeholder. Why is this? Because for a natural system, continued existence is an axiom.

Maybe that's the definition of a human. A human is the only living thing that can make a non-natural system. Or maybe their existence is hierarchically subordinate to humans existing.

It's not that their systems are not "natural" meaning not belonging to the natural world. It means that their systems' existence is based upon their own subjective judgement.

A system is an instance of something which was created by an existing system and has until now kept itself operating.

So let's take a particular cordless screwdriver. I mean one single one that was produced by a manufacturer and ended up on a shelf. I don't mean a make or model. The instance of the screwdriver was produced by a system: a business created by humans. It was also produced by a set of machines and tools that were created by humans. At the end of the day, all the systems created by humans are technology. The humans are natural, but their output is what we call technology. But what about beaver technology? I think it's okay to also call that technology.

I would fight the temptation to consider a system to be the _idea_ of a cordless screwdriver. It should be thought of as the _physical manifestation_ of the idea of a cordless screwdriver. An idea is only real because it is carried in the heads of real beings. If all the beings that held that idea died, and it was not recorded in a way that could be retrieved later, it would be annihilated. I don't mean killed; I mean annihilated -- just the same as the world was before it ever existed.

The design of a cordless screwdriver is also a system. As long as it continues to be used and kept in service, it continues to be a system.

Maybe that's the difference between dead and annihilated. Dead means the world is different than it was before it existed. Annihilated means the world is no different than it would have been had it never existed. Or the world has no memory of it having existed before. The life force of the body is annihilated. The physical body is dead.

## Maximize Value of the Organization {#id2673830222}

#2673830222

The goal of management should be to maximize the value of the organization. This is not easy because value is in the eye of the beholder. Who should decide if we are adding value?

## Benefit-Cost Analysis Steps {#id5886410222}

#5886410222

1. Define the problem. What is the dilemma we are facing?

1. Identify possible alternatives, always including "do nothing."

1. For each benefit, estimate the benefits, $B$, and estimate the costs, $C$, and use them to calculate the net benefits $(B - C)$. Discount costs back to a common time period such as _the present_.

1. Compare $(B-C)$ for each option including "do nothing."

1. Select the best option which is the one with the greatest net benefits $(B - C)$.

## Cleaning {#id5870650222}

#5870650222

Today I did my weekly Sunday cleaning routine, cleaning for 1 hours. Here's what I did:

- Vacuumed Master Suite
- Vacuumed living room
- Vacuumed family room
- Vacuumed kitchen
- Vacuumed hall outside the kids' room.
- Cleaned the kids' mirror.
- Cleaned the front door and side light windows.
- Sorted objects from the living room and family room.
- Processed my In Box.
- Removed the table top and stool tops from the old round table.

## Lunch {#id5884500222}

#5884500222

For lunch we had grilled chicken with Open Pit barbecue sauce and Rice-A-Roni. This time I cooked the chicken a little different. I set up the grill for indirect cooking, but then I cooked the chicken about half the time directly. Only toward the end when I was basting them in sauce did I move them to the indirect area of the grill. I think the chicken turned out better than the last few times.

## Animal Simulator {#id5893480222}

#5893480222

I've been playing around with an animal simulator in Python.

## Python Serialization Options {#id5879720222}

#5879720222

1. **Pickle 

- No good because it can expose you to security risk. Someone can inject code that will allow them to gain access to your machine.

1. **Shelve 

- Same problem as Pickle, because it uses Pickle on the backend.

1. **Marshal 

- Same problem as Pickle. Used mostly internally by Python.

1. **dbm 

- Whoosh, this one is something weird from GNU that is over my head.

## Axis and Allies Python Package {#id5862750222}

#5862750222

I started a Python package and made the first commit to the Github repository:

<https://github.com/joelegner/axis-and-allies>

It runs many simulations of battles and tells you who won the most out of all the attempts.

Example battle report for 2 armor and 2 infantry attacking 4 infantry:

```

Attacker probability 0.573 with average of 1.21 units left, defender 0.427 with average of 0.78 units left.
```

I can use it to experiment a little. What does the attacker's winning percentage do if I add 1 more armor?

```
2020-08-12 08:25:22.555412
************Start run #1 of 1000

[snip]

in 1000 battles the attackers won 883 times and the defenders won 117 times in an average of 2.71 rounds.
Attacker probability 0.883 with average of 2.59 units left, defender 0.117 with average of 0.15 units left.
```

This time the attacker won 88% of the time. With only 2 armor, the winning percentage was 57%. Adding an armor made a big difference.

## Dark Mode {#id5882930222}

I changed `pandoc.css` to make it dark mode. Here's what it looks like in case I change it in the future.

## Electricity and Human Motivation {#id5860590222}

#5860590222

Electricity flows through a conductor when there is a difference in charge between the two ends. This circumstance is alternately called:

- Difference in potential
- Voltage
- Electromotive force

My understanding of electricity is primitive and fairly naive, but it's close enough for what I'm about to say. Perhaps as I learn more about electricity the following analogy will be improved upon.

Maybe similarly humans are motivated by a difference in emotions. In this analogy:

- Conductor = length of time
- Let time be represented by $t$ where $t=0$ is the present moment, $t>0$ is the future, and $t<0$ is the past. Note that only $t=0$ truly exists. The others are in your head.
- An emotion exists at $t=0$, call it $E_0$. 
- A perceived future emotion exists at time $t$, $E_t$. This emotion is felt by the body as excitement, fear, longing, curiosity, or other action-inducing emotions.
- A person is motivated to act when $E_0 \neq E_t$.
- A person is not motivated to act when $E_0 \approx E_t$. They do not want things to be different than they are now. It is the state of contentedness. This is the Buddha's state of mind. How he achieved it is kind of outlined below.

Maybe we could call this difference in potential the **emotional-motivational force**. Perhaps it would be: $F = E_t - E_0$.

We can let positive emotions have a positive sign and negative emotions have a negative sign.

- An emotion is positive when $E_i > 0$.
- An emotion is negative when $E_i < 0$.
- An emotion is neutral when $E_i \approx 0$.  I use approximately because it's probably not possible to achieve perfect neutrality unless you are the Buddha.

While a Buddhist monk is sitting breathing for long periods of time, the monk's $F = 0$, presumably because $E_0 \approx 0$ and $E_t$ is undefined, because they are not thinking about the future. They are in the moment.

**Note:** Somebody has probably already thought of all this. I cannot recall ever having seen it, but I might have and forgot the incident.

## Virtual Happy Hour {#id5863680222}

#5863680222

I hosted a virtual happy hour for TECO employees tonight. Only a few showed up: Veronica, Paul, David, Amy, and me and Julie. It was so-so. At the end Julie did some Mad Gab cards for David, Paul, and Kristen, and that part was the best part. 

We ordered pizzas again, and we are going to order them on Sunday, too when Joey and I complete our last run.

## LegLib on PyPi {#id5873630222}

#5873630222

For the first time in my life I added a package to PyPi.

<https://pypi.org/project/leglib/0.0.4/>

![First PyPi Package: leglib 0.0.4](images/leglib-pypi.png)


## Crosman Pistol O-Ring {#id5880420222}

#5880420222

We had ordered some .22 pellets for an old Crossman pistol that Terry gave the boys. It is a Crosman Mark 1 Target pistol. We received the pellets today. Joe and I tried to install a cartridge, but the O-ring was old, brittle, and cracked. All the gas leaked out.

![Crosman Pistol O-Ring Measurements](images/crosman-o-ring-measurements.png)

It looks like the outside diameter is about 3/4-inch and the width is 3/32-inch.

I found a chart of O-rings on the [allorings.com website](https://www.allorings.com/userAssets/file/USAStandardSizes02.pdf) and entered it using 3/32 = 0.09375 for the value of C.S. and 3/4 = 0.750 for the value of O.D.

Here are the options and the error in the measurements:

**Size 113**: C.S. = 0.103 inch and O.D. = 0.755 inch. The error for C.S. then is $|0.103 - 0.09375|/0.103 \times 100 = 9$ percent and the error for O.D. is $(0.755 - 0.750)/0.755 \times 100 = 0.7$ percent. Not bad.

**Size 016**: C.S. = 0.70 inch and O.D. = 0.754 inch. The error for C.S. then is $|0.070 - 0.09375|/0.070 \times 100 = 34$ percent and the error for O.D. is $(0.754 - 0.750)/0.754 \times 100 = 0.5$ percent.

Visually it looks like it could be a little over 3/32 inch anyway, so I think Size 113 is the correct size.

![O-ring Size 113](images/o-ring-order.png)

## OBS Install {#id5898610222}

#5898610222

I am going to help Julie get better sound and video on her OBS. I downloaded it and installed it.

![OBS Auto-Configuration Wizard Results](images/obs-auto-config-2020-08-18.png)

## OBS Audio Settings {#id5868720222}

#5868720222

Here are some tips I've already gleaned from watching YouTube videos.

- Add noise gate if in a loud environment. This would probably be appropriate for me with Julie. The Close Threshold should be a little higher than the Open Threshold.
- In a somewhat noisy background, use noise suppression.
- Add compressor. Leave the defaults.
- Peak level should be -3 dB. Zero is the far right. To get to the -3 dB, add a Gain filter.
- Last filter we need is the limiter. The threshold should be -3 dB.

## The Most Important Lesson {#id5891930222}

#5891930222

The most important lesson is that the fear of suffering is already suffering. So you should never fear. You can trust that you will not _try_ to do something that causes suffering. If you believe this, you will trust yourself and need not fear the suffering.

> Let me take fear of failure as an example.  I know right now, as you’re reading this, you’re dreaming of something.  You long for a change.

> You’re imagining what life could be like “if” you could have all that you dreamed of.

> But you’re terrified of trying, because by trying you might, just might, not get there and failing for you is just not an option. You’re worried what ‘people’ might think.  You’re scared you’ll be judged.  You’re also petrified that your own high standards won’t be met.

> And so, you do nothing at all.
Because if you tried and failed, well you’d be right back to where you are now.
Which is exactly the same place that you’re terrified of being if you don’t succeed.

- Don't be afraid of others judging you negatively or you will already be suffering.

- Don't be afraid of judging yourself negatively or you will already be suffering.

- Don't be afraid of others Julie you negatively or you will already be suffering.

This is probably what **anxiety 

is all about: people suffering because they are always afraid of future suffering of any kind, even suffering because you are afraid. Do not be afraid, and you will not suffer.

When you feel like saying, "Oh no, I will forget this," you are already suffering. If you worry your future self will say, "Boy, was I stupid," you are already suffering. Confidence is feeling you will succeed, even when you cannot be sure, because you do not fear the uncertainty. You live in the now.

You should fantasize, but only if you can do it without fear that it will never come true. Again, this is confidence. It's wanting without demanding. It's wanting, but being open to not getting.

Being afraid of being too empathetic is already suffering.

Thinking of the next right thing to do rationally is not based upon fear.# 2020-08-27 First Run after Couch to 5K

I was finally able to get Joey up actually he got up at a reasonable hour this morning, so we went running. We looked at his app, and found that we ran 3.2 miles in 30 minutes. So rather than run 35 minutes, we just ran for 30 minutes. It was good, we talked a little bit about meditation and anxiety and subjects like that. When we got home, Julie made Sriracha bacon in the oven. Then I got to work.

## First Principles {#id0214060222}

#0214060222

#philosophy #metaphysics #ontology

What do I believe without question?

1. There is a physical universe.

1. Time only moves forward.

## Causation {#id5891720222}

#5891720222

For an event A to _cause_ an event B, the following must be true:

1. A occurs prior to B in time.

1. There is a chain of physical connections between the matter involved in event A and the matter involved in event B.


## Animal Simulation Thoughts {#id5878650222}

#5878650222

- Each animal should have a reservoir of energy. 

- Energy is derived from food sources: plants or other animals. 

- A larger body requires more energy. There is probably a power law for this.

- There would be losses of energy in each feeding. Only a fraction of the energy stored in the body would get added to the predator's body.

- There would be sensing capabilities.

An animal's day would include either resting all day or hunting for food or courting (hunting) a mate. 

```python

class Animal:

    def __init__(self):
        self.energy = 0     # kilojoules
        self.x = 0          # meters
        self.y = 0          # meters
        self.z = 0          # meters
        self.mass = 0       # kilograms

## Model Engineering Calculation {#id0115060222}

If I was going to model an engineering calculation, I would want to model it like this:

        Table of Contents
    Mainmatter
        Section
            Paragraph

                Paragraph
    Backmatter
        Index
```

A `paragraph` could be a few sentences in prose or it could be a mathematical equation.

The way the thing could work would be like this. For any one problem you would need the problem input, a procedure, a series of templates for steps in the procedure, and an engine for doing the processing.

There would be a procedure to design a steel beam under a certain edition of the AISC Specification, for example. It might be very complex, for it needs to be able to branch off for hollow structural sections, wide flanges, angles, etc. 

A procedure can depend upon another procedure. For example, the flexural design procedure may depend on the section categorization procedure (compact, non-compact, etc. at the same time as the axial design procedure and the flexural analysis procedure.

A procedure has two kinds of requirements: its own, and the requirements of its dependencies (sub-procedures).

```zsh
$ python -m pycalcs input.yml > output.md
$ pandoc ... output.md -o output.pdf
```

The steps involved in this could be the major components.

1. Parse the input file into input data.
2. Select the design procedure called for in the input file.
3. Go through the procedure, using the input data.

The main triage section only needs to know what version of the program you are expecting and what design procedure you need. The rest of the input file contents are data for the procedure. They will be validated against the requirements of the procedure: the procedure input specification.

Input can be complex like a YAML document. The first step of the solution engine is to validate the input and throw an error if it is invalid.

```python
def parse(input_file):
    input_data, procedure_name = process_yml_file(input_file)
    return input_data, procedure_name

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_data, procedure_name = parse(input_file)
    procedure = __import__(procedure_name)

    if procedure.validate(input_data):
        output_data = procedure.run(input_data)
        procedure.report(output_data)
```

The `input_data` should be a `__dict__` that was converted from the YAML file. 

The `output_data` could be a `__dict__` or maybe JSON that could be parsed as part of a report template system.

What would an input file look like?

```yaml
procedure: DesignSteelBeam
version: 1.0
code: AISC 13th Edition
beam: 
```

## Functional Programming {#id0015060222}

#0015060222

#functional-programming #programming #python

I have been interested in Functional Programming lately. My language of choice is of course Python. How would Functional Programming look in Python?

Could the program be such that it takes one argument, say a filename as an input and then returns a result, say a report string?

```
result = f(filename)
```

Could we connect it with Pandoc to create a PDF?

```zsh
$ program(filename) > result.md
$ source venv/bin/activate && pandoc -f markdown+implicit_figures  --filter pandoc-fignos result.md -o result.pdf
```

## Living on a Boat {#id5863650222}

#5863650222

What if we lived on a boat instead of in a house or apartment (condo)? How much would it cost? Could we really do it? Would we have to sell our current house?

There would be two states of living on the boat:
- Living docked at a marina.
- Living sailing or anchored not at a marina.

When living at a marina, you would have access to restaurants, virtually unlimited fresh water, electricity, the Internet, health care, 

These local marinas allow people to sleep overnight.

1. Blind Pass Marina, St. Pete Beach
1. Gulfport Municipal Marina, Gulfport
1. Harborage Marina, St. Petersburg
1. Longboat Key Marina, Longboat Key
1. Parrot Cove Marina, Bradenton
1. Pasadena Marina, St. Petersburg
1. Regatta Pointe Marina, Bradenton
1. Riviera Dunes Marina, Palmetto
1. St. Petersburg Municipal Marina, St. Pete
1. Twin Dolphin Marina, Bradenton 

Suppose we lived in each for 365/10 = 36.5 days a year each?

## Requirements, Processes, and Deliverables {#id1615060222}

#1615060222

#requirement #process #deliverable #project-management

One way to think about a project is to think of the project organization as a set of processes that transform inputs into outputs. For a project, the inputs are the requirements. You can broadly think of anything that limits or directs project activities as a "requirement." 

Perhaps a requirement is anything that affects the production of a deliverable or creates the need for a new deliverable.

![The Project Organization](images/reqirements-processes-deliverables.png)

A written requirement can import other requirements. So adding the requirement that the design meet a written design criteria incorporates all the requirements in the design criteria document.


## Moving to New Zealand {#id5895710222}

#5895710222

I looked up the top 10 countries with the best standard of living, and all the top 10 except New Zealand are pretty much cold climate Northern European countries. New Zealand is also an island, so a little like Florida -- a peninsula. Here are some random thoughts about it:

1. I would not want to move before Tommy is out of high school. I wonder what colleges are in New Zealand?

1. We would have to do some research about how to get a work visa to go there. 

1. What if we formulated a plan to buy a nice boat, learn to sail it safely, and then when the day comes in a few years, sail it to New Zealand and start a new life there?

1. Might consider seeking a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification to bolster my already pretty strong resume.

## Organization of Boeing 747 Manual {#id5892340222}

#5892340222

The other day during one of my downtimes ("time wasting time") I suddenly got the urge to Google a Boeing 747 manual. I figured that a company like Boeing with such incredible excellence that they can design fighter planes and spaceships would write a really good manual. Boy I was not disappointed one bit. The thing is a masterpiece. It's the best manual I've ever seen.

## Seneca the Younger on the Terrors of Death {#id5891590222}

#5891590222

Here is one on death that I like. It is from this letter the translator called, ["On the Terrors of Death"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_4).

> 1. Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace with itself. Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the time when you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when one's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.

He seems to be advising the reader to continue his philosophical pursuits. This jives pretty well with my "Lifelong Learner" identity I am cultivating by doing things like reading the letters of Seneca the Younger.

> 2. You remember, of course, what joy you felt when you laid aside the garments of boyhood and donned the man's toga, and were escorted to the forum; nevertheless, you may look for a still greater joy when you have laid aside the mind of boyhood and when wisdom has enrolled you among men. For it is not boyhood that still stays with us, but something worse, – boyishness. And this condition is all the more serious because we possess the authority of old age, together with the follies of boyhood, yea, even the follies of infancy. Boys fear trifles, children fear shadows, we fear both.

I like the part here where old men -- still boyish -- yet have authority. Old men fear little things and shadows. The little things are little, and the shadows are nothing.

> 3. All you need to do is to advance; you will thus understand that some things are less to be dreaded, precisely because they inspire us with great fear.

I'm not sure what he is getting at here. The first clause seems to be about the reader continuing to grow in wisdom by his pursuit of philosophy. That things are less to be dreaded because they inspire us with fear is interesting, but I have not worked out how I would paraphrase it.

> No evil is great which is the last evil of all. Death arrives; it would be a thing to dread, if it could remain with you. But death must either not come at all, or else must come and pass away.

The "last evil of all" must be the cause of your death. Not dreading it because it is fleeting is brilliant and poetical.

> 4. "It is difficult, however," you say, "to bring the mind to a point where it can scorn life." But do you not see what trifling reasons impel men to scorn life? One hangs himself before the door of his mistress; another hurls himself from the house-top that he may no longer be compelled to bear the taunts of a bad-tempered master; a third, to be saved from arrest after running away, drives a sword into his vitals. Do you not suppose that virtue will be as efficacious as excessive fear?

Many are those who want to die for trivial things. Likewise you can be ready for your own death. It is inevitable anyway. Might as well not fear death while life is still around.

> No man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it, or believes that living through many consulships is a great blessing. 

This is quite Buddhist sounding. He's saying that those who cling to life cannot truly enjoy it. It also reminds me of Jesus saying, "He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal" (John 12:25). I don't think this was Buddhist teaching by the author of John. It's more a carrot and a stick: if you are rich enough to enjoy your life, God will punish you in the afterlife, but if you are suffering in this life, God will make it right in the end. No wonder Christianity caught on at a time when life was worse than shitty.

> 5. Rehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to depart from life contentedly; for many men clutch and cling to life, even as those who are carried down a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks. Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die. 

Very Buddhist here and wise. This bit was what led me to do this little primitive commentary.

> 6. For this reason, make life as a whole agreeable to yourself by banishing all worry about it. No good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort than that which, when lost, cannot be missed. Therefore, encourage and toughen your spirit against the mishaps that afflict even the most powerful.

See [2020-08-26 The Most Important Lesson].

> 7. For example, the fate of Pompey was settled by a boy and a eunuch, that of Crassus by a cruel and insolent Parthian. Gaius Caesar ordered Lepidus to bare his neck for the axe of the tribune Dexter; and he himself offered his own throat to Chaerea. No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him. Do not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its depths. The very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed. 

So very true how "fate" can change in an instant.

> 8. Reflect that a highwayman or an enemy may cut your throat; and, though he is not your master, every slave wields the power of life and death over you. Therefore I declare to you: he is lord of your life that scorns his own. Think of those who have perished through plots in their own homes, slain either openly or by guile; you will then understand that just as many have been killed by angry slaves as by angry kings. What matter, therefore, how powerful he be whom you fear, when every one possesses the power which inspires your fear? 

"He is lord of your life that scorns is own" is an important lesson. The person who scorns his life is not afraid to lose it. He is not desperate, he is jaded. He is dangerous. Thinking about the world right now, there are people out there with terribly bad lives who would cause harm to others because they hate the world. To Seneca's wisdom I would add my own: try to take pity on the man who scorns his life, for he is miserable.

> 9. "But," you will say, "if you should chance to fall into the hands of the enemy, the conqueror will command that you be led away," – yes, whither you are already being led. Why do you voluntarily deceive yourself and require to be told now for the first time what fate it is that you have long been labouring under? Take my word for it: since the day you were born you are being led thither. We must ponder this thought, and thoughts of the like nature, if we desire to be calm as we await that last hour, the fear of which makes all previous hours uneasy.

Do not fear being led away to be put to death, for your life is already leading you to death since the day you were born. Do not lie to yourself: you are going to die. Better to reflect on this idea with an open mind if you want to be calm during your last moments. Otherwise, all the hours preceding this will be frought.

> 10. But I must end my letter. Let me share with you the saying which pleased me to-day. It, too, is culled from another man's Garden: "Poverty brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth." Do you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us? Merely to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. In order to banish hunger and thirst, it is not necessary for you to pay court at the doors of the purse-proud, or to submit to the stern frown, or to the kindness that humiliates; nor is it necessary for you to scour the seas, or go campaigning; nature's needs are easily provided and ready to hand.

Most of what we do is unnecessary. What is necessary is to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. Food, water, shelter, and maybe a few basics he skipped over are all we need. The rest is due to discontent. This may be a Stoic philosophy.

> 11. It is the superfluous things for which men sweat, – the superfluous things that wear our togas threadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign shores. That which is enough is ready to our hands. He who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich. Farewell.

It might be in another Seneca letter, but I recently heard the idea that you need money for the necessities of life and to buy "that which is enough." For if it is enough, you are at peace -- like the Buddha.

## Attic Rats {#id5867640222}

#5867640222

We sometimes get roof rats living in our attic or on our porch. A few days ago we heard them on the metal roof over the porch, so we put out some traps. The first day with the traps they took the bait but did not get caught. The second day we got one. Not sure if there were more than one, I re-baited the trap.

The next day in the early evening when it was pretty dark, we heard the trap go off. Julie held her iPhone light so I could see while we investigated. There was a rat in the trap with the trap pinching its waist. I was about to go get a bag to throw away the corpse when Julie exclaimed, "I think it's still alive!" Sure enough, the damn thing was breathing.

I felt pity on the creature and decided to dispatch its life to put it out of its misery. I grabbed a log from our log pile and bashed in its head unceramoniously. To my horror, the thing was still apparently alive after that blow. It's hard to know if it was conscious, but it was still moving significantly. I then resolved to make sure the job got done right and bashed it over and over again. Julie was squeemish - and I was too. The rat even gave out a squeek on about the 2nd blow which added to our feelings of guilt.

I feel okay knowing that I did in good faith try to put it out of its misery and did so as quickly as I could do - I was just incompetent the first time. Next time I will make it a quick and certain death.

## Cryptocurrency {#id1314060222}

#1314060222

#crypto-currency

I watched a [video by 3Blue1Brown on cryptocurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDN52m7Y21ePrTbvXkPaWVSg&index=6).

You can record your transactions with friends using a **ledger**. The ledger system protocol is:

1. Anyone can add lines to the ledger.

2. At the end of the month you settle up with real money.

This system has a serious flaw: item 1 opens the door for someone to cheat the system. What keeps Bob from adding a fictitious line saying that he paid Alice $100? Nothing. It requires perfect trust.

How can we resolve the trust issue? We can impose the requirement that the person who is paying has to add their _signature_ to the line in the ledger where they are paying.

This is all well and good, but we need a way to do this digitally. The way it is done is that each person using the ledger create a **private key 

and **public key 

pair. The private key is sometimes also called a **secret key 

so that it can be abbreviated as "SK" while "PK" is used for _public_ key. 

A digital signature is better than a real-world signatrue, becuase the digital signature is unique to each message. Your hand signature looks pretty much the same each time.

`Sign(Message, SK) = Signature`

For you to trust the system, it needs to be such that there is no way to verify the message is authrorized if you do not know the secret (or private) key.

`Verify(Message, Signature, PK) = True or False`

How do we make sure they cannot be guessed easily? We use 256 bit security. This gives us $2^{256}$ key combinations. The ledger system also requires that each line have a unique `Message + SK` signature. That way nobody can simply duplicate lines with valid signatures.

OK, this is great so far. But we still have a problem. How do we know that someone will pay the amount of _real_ cash at the end of each month? How do we trust the settlement process? How about this: each person ponies up a "real" cash amount at the beginning of the ledger. They can add or deduct from their balance as long as it remains above zero. No overspending is allowed. For this to work, we need to know the entire history of transactions at any given time so we can determine if the next proposed transaction is valid -- does the person have the money in their account?

We could have an entire economy using the ledger now. For convenience, let's call the "fake" money in the ledger as **ledger dollars 

and abbreviate them LD.

The key insight here is of course this:

> Bitcoin is a trustwrothy digital ledger.

We still have a serious problem, I'm afraid. No individual can trust that they are keeping the same ledger as everyone else in the marketplace. It is this problem that the original Bitcoin paper solved elegantly and which made cryptocurrencies viable.

The cool idea of the paper is that there is computational work. The ledger is encrypted using a SHA-256 which is bascially a 256-bit representation of a message. The `SHAF256()` function is a one-way function. It's possible to go from the message to the resulting hash, but not the other direction. And it's impossible to predict the output of the `SHA256()` function. What the paper did was this: find a number which produces a hash that starts with 30 straight zeroes. There are $2^30 \approx 1$ billion ways to combine those 30 digits. Only one of them is all zeroes. So a random number will only produce the 30 zeroes 1 time out of a billion. Since `SHA256()` is unpredictable, we must brute-force go through these billion numbers until we find one that correctly produces a hash starting with 30 zeroes. The special number is called the **proof of work 

because it takes computing power to find.

A **block 

is a set of transaction with the _proof of work_ number appended. It must also have the previous block's hash _prepended_. Changing any block or re-ordering them will break the chain. For example, if you swap the order of two blocks, you change the prepended hash which causes the block's hash to be totally different. Then you have to find a new _proof of work_ to get back to 30 zeroes.

## Thoughts on Joe the Developer {#id5893960222}

#5893960222

I do not seem to stay motivated when there is not an obvious problem to solve in front of me. Back when I created the Legner Engineering Intranet site and BEARS, I was trying to solve very specific problems: how to manage a business and how to get work done efficiently and accurately so I could make money. Now I work for the power company. I don't have to worry about the business as much. And I don't really design anything. So I've been toying around with ideas like a dueling pianos app. But that one kind of died on the vine - first because I set it aside to finish my Master's degree and then because COVID-19 made it seem not as value-added with little to no dueling shows occurring.

## Nim Programming Language {#id5871800222}

#5871800222

I heard about a programming language called Nim that resembles Python but compiles to C, so it should run much faster I would think. To test this theory, I wrote the following two programs to flip a coin 1,000,000 times and report how many heads and tails were flipped.

Python version:
```python
import random

random.seed()

heads, tails = 0, 0

for i in range(0, 1000000):
    if random.randint(0, 1) == 1:
        heads = heads + 1
    else:
        tails += 1

print(f"{heads} heads and {tails} tails")
```

Nim version:
```nim
import random

var heads, tails: int = 0

randomize()

for i in countup(1, 1000000):
    if rand(1) == 1:
        heads = heads + 1
    else:
        inc(tails)

echo heads, " heads and ", tails, " tails."
```

Then I ran them and wouldn't you know it, the Nim version was much faster.

```zsh
joelegner:nim-playground/ $ time python3 flip.py                                                                                                                                           [12:50:19]
499004 heads and 500996 tails
python3 flip.py  1.12s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 1.150 total
joelegner:nim-playground/ $ time ./flip                                                                                                                                                     [8:48:39]
499336 heads and 500664 tails.
./flip  0.07s user 0.00s system 94% cpu 0.074 total
```

Python took 1.15 seconds, while Nim only took 0.074 seconds. So Python took 15 times as long to do the work.

## Thomas Jefferson on Newspapers {#id5892840222}

#5892840222

I found this letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Norvell almost painfully apropos for today. It harmonizes with my worldview. 

Source: <https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/amendI_speechs29.html>

> To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, "by restraining it to true facts & sound principles only." Yet I fear such a paper would find few subscribers. It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could not more compleatly deprive the nation of it's benefits, than is done by it's abandoned prostitution to falsehood. Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knolege with the lies of the day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live & die in the belief, that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time; whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables. General facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great [Volume 5, Page 170] portion of Europe to his will, &c., &c.; but no details can be relied on. I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods & errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false.

> Perhaps an editor might begin a reformation in some such way as this. Divide his paper into 4 chapters, heading the 1st, Truths. 2d, Probabilities. 3d, Possibilities. 4th, Lies. The first chapter would be very short, as it would contain little more than authentic papers, and information from such sources as the editor would be willing to risk his own reputation for their truth. The 2d would contain what, from a mature consideration of all circumstances, his judgment should conclude to be probably true. This, however, should rather contain too little than too much. The 3d & 4th should be professedly for those readers who would rather have lies for their money than the blank paper they would occupy.

## Ramblings {#id5862720222}

#5862720222

Regret is the pain you feel from a decision resulting in an unwanted outcome. You expected the decision to go the other way. It could be eliminated entirely if you could instill in yourself the belief that you are using good decision-making processes and uncertainty is just part of life. Buddhism would say something along the lines that your expectation led to the pain. If you eliminate the expectation, you eliminate the pain.

Being afraid to do or say something is what your planning mind expects you to feel if you do it or say it. The feeling of fear is not quite the same as pain, but it is definitely a negative emotion. You would rather not be afraid. Fear points away from action. It points to inaction or alternate action.

If you are afraid to walk on thin ice, you are imagining yourself suffering in the cold water.

What would it be like to have zero fear? Let's start there and work backwords. With zero fear, you would only be motivated by desire for something like food. I guess 

Expectation is the delusion that everything is going to work out the way you want it or better. Aspiration is the reality. You might not get what you want. Aspiration is imporant, because it gets us to strive for things. It motivates us. We are motivated to aspire to a number of simultaneous outcomes, some of which are logically contradictory. But all this insanity ends up in quite a steady state, steady enough for the body carrying it to survive in a very complicated and messed-up, human-filled world for many decades. The only thing that gives out now, growing old, may also fall victim to the march of man's knowledge. Maybe someday our ancestors will know how to live longer, even very long. It would be no contradiction for our ancestors to breed themselves to get happier and happier over the centuries, but I do not believe it will happen.

We should do everything in our power to spread ideas that increase happiness. Any idea that increases happiness without reducing the happiness of another is a step in the right direction. We take baby steps. We see if this direction looks promising, and we go there and then take stock of everyone's happyiness level. If it moved up, we are content. The amount of joy that the happyiness generates should be integrated over time for all people. The idea you want people to have is that they should make other people happy as often as possible, which is to say they should be kind and benevolent. If this got going and really spread, it would change the world. Kindness should have a feedback loop with happiness, too, because it feels good to be kind. It also feels good to get back at someone. The first motive is better, because it makes two people happy. The second motive only makes you happy. I guess maybe a friend would be happy for you, but that chain is going to go off to infinity. We should stick with worrying about the primary beneficiary or victim of the act. 

## Impermanence {#id5878470222}

I had a sense of impermanence today. I was sitting at my computer around 7:45 in the evening, yawning like crazy. It felt good, because I had worked out this morning, and it felt like my body was actually tired for once. I will probably sleep well. What occurred to me was that yesterday I was a ball of energy in the evening, reading voraciously and frantically adding Anki cards to capture the knowledge. I read some things about Buddhism.  I read a book about probability. It's funny how impermanent a good day or a high-energy feeling is. Nothing lasts. Chuckling about it seems more appropriate than despairing that every day cannot be a good day.

## Python Project {#id5884690222}

#5884690222

I so wish I had a project to develop in Python. I tried that decision making app but ran out of motivation for it.

## Writing {#id5884740222}

#5884740222

I like writing. I feel like I'm getting better at it. My sentences now have a flow to them that they did not seem to have before. I was always a pretty good academic writer, but what else can I write? I could try fiction. I've always threatened to. But I have these high aspirations for my first work that I don't think I can deliver. I want it to be at once a philosophical work and a moving literary masterpiece. Maybe instead I should just write _something_ and see where it goes from there.

## Engineering Units Project {#id0414060222}

#0414060222

#python #engineering #units

I've got a vague idea to make a Python project that will handle engineering units: feet, inches, kips, pounds, kip-feet, meters, newtons, newton-meters, and so on. What do I want it to look like? Let's brainstorm the usage and see if it seems fun.

```python
>>> from units import inches, feet, psf, kips
>>> L = 10.0*feet
>>> L
10.0 ft
>>> B = 8*feet
>>> B
8.0 ft
>>> B*L
80.0 ft^2
>>> q = 100.0*psf
>>> q
100.0 psf
>>> P = q*B*L
>>> P
8000.0 lb
>>> P.convert(kips) # Changes P
>>> P
8.0 kips
>>> P.in_units(pounds) # Does not change P
8000.0 lb
>>> P 
8.0 kips
```

## Toshiba External Hard Drive Backup {#id5876930222}

#5876930222

Now that I am using my Mac almost exclusively, I had to come up with a way to back up my Google Drive to my Toshiba external hard drive. I re-wrote my `backup-toshiba.sh` script, but it was not working. It turns out that NTFS disks are read-only for MacOS. So I had to reformat it as `exFAT` based on what I read here: 
<https://www.trickyways.com/2019/12/format-external-hard-drive-to-use-mac-and-pc/>

My backup script is now just a one-liner:
```bash

## Kayak Trip Checklist {#id5878730222}

#5878730222

I created a new Kayak Trip Checklist under Google Drive / Tools / Checklists.

## Checklist App Idea {#id5873400222}

#5873400222

I have an idea for a checklist application. First let me give you an idea of the kind of checklist I mean.

![Example Checklist Format](images/checklist-example.png)

The structure seems to include the following.

1. A title.
1. A set of hold points: Before Engine Start, Engine Start (normal), Engine Start (flooded), ..., Shutdown.
1. A list for each hold point. Each list line item consists of:
    A. An integer number 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
    B. A noun which represents either:
        1. A physical object: seats, flaps, parking break
        1. A control selector: flap switch, oil pressure
        1. An instrument: airspeed, suction gage.
    C. The desired state of object represented by said noun: on, off, up, set, 1000 RPM, 100 MPH.

Each **checklist 

contains:

- Property: Title
- Property: Author Name
- Property: Latest Date / Time
- Children: Set of $n$ hold points.

Each **hold point 

contains:

- Property: hold point name
- Children: Set of $m$ line items.

Each **checklist item 

(line item) contains:

- Property: Sequence number (integer)
- Property: Object (noun)
- Property: Desired state (adverb or adjective)

We will also need a way to record what happened when we used the checklist. We will call this a checklist encounter.

Each **checklist encounter 

contains:

- Property: Datetime of encounter start.
- Property: Datetime of encounter end.
- Children: Set of $p$ checklist item result objects.

Each **checklist line item result 

contains:

- Property: Pointer to checklist item.
- Property: Completed boolean
- Property: Datetime the box was checked.

## Backyard Table {#id5899770222}

#5899770222

We had an old table that was made for indoors, and we had it on the porch. The table top was some kind of pressed wood crap which started getting moldy. So I discarded the old top and made plans to install a new table top. At first I thought it should be a round top, but we settled on square because it is easier to build and gives a little more surface area.

![Table Top Sketch](images/table-top-drawing.png)

## Duolingo {#id5862790222}

#5862790222

Today is Sunday. I am starting the lessons **Shopping 5 

and **Health 2 

on Duolingo. Duolingo shows that I have learned 2932 words in Spanish. Recall that my goal is 10,000 words to be fluent. I started on May 21, 2019 which means I have been learning Spanish for 1 year, 6 months, and 8 days which is 558 days not including today.

Let's do a simple extrapolation to get to the day when I will know 10,000 words:

$$D_{10,000} = \dfrac{10,000}{2932}558 = 1,903\text{ days}$$

The remaining days to get to 10,000 then would be 1,903 - 558 = 1,345 days which puts estimated completion at August 5, 2024.

## Sobriety Day 3 {#id5867440222}

#5867440222

We are still going strong on our quest not to drink alcohol anymore. Julie is really down right now. She is not talking much, either, which worries me. She decided to watch the last season of [_The Handmaid's Tale_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)), because she had started it, and it just became available to watch inexpensively. But the story itself is depressing, and she keeps seeing ads in between that are depressing -- reminders of COVID-19 and how sucky the world is right now. I would rather she do something wholesome like play music online, but we shall see. Hopefully she will regain her energy later this afternoon and play music.

## Ontologies {#id5880480222}

#5880480222

Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_components>

An ontology is a system of definitions and interrelations that describe a "domain of discourse." 

> ...an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.

Almost universal components of ontologies:

- **Individuals**: The basic, ground level objects.

- **Classes**: Sets, collections, concepts, types of objects, or kinds of things

- **Attributes**: Aspects, properties, features, characteristics, or parameters that objects and classes can have.

- **Relations**: Ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another.

Less common components include:

- **Function terms**: Complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement 

- **Restrictions**: Formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input

- **Rules**: Statements in the form of an if-then (antecedent-consequent) sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form

- **Axioms**: Assertions (including rules) in a logical form that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application. This definition differs from that of "axioms" in generative grammar and formal logic. In those disciplines, axioms include only statements asserted as a priori knowledge. As used here, "axioms" also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements

- **Events**: The changing of attributes or relations

## Django Installation {#id5875570222}

#5875570222

Today I installed Django using [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django). Here were my settings:

```

After that I installed PostgreSQL 12 using the command:

```bash
$ brew install postgresql@12
```

I used version 12 because Cookiecutter Django does not prompt for version 13.

I also had to add this to `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/bin:$PATH"
```

This gave me some weird error, so I uninstalled it and instead installed `Postgres.app` from this website: <https://postgresapp.com/>. This seemed to work.

## Systems Thinking {#id5883440222}

#5883440222

A system is an entity made up of interrelated, interdependent parts that acts in a purposive way. It exists in an environment with other system. Its top-level parts are subsystems. Each subsystem is a complete system in its own right. The subsystem's environment is the parent system.

Each person in the organization is not part of the organization's system. It is not even an input, but its service is. It's more like a tool. A person is its own complete (and very complex I might add) system. It is a service provider. Services include sensing things, thinking, and physical labor. We should treat each employee like a contractor: define the work to be done and the minimum expectations. They _how_ is more flexible. The individual can contribute ways to do things, improvise, etc.

A job description should have the same parts as a Construction Scope of Work.

The OPM department is providing information to its environment. It takes labor, money, raw materials, and information as inputs and outputs information, constructed materials, and money. 

The labor is the engine that converts the information into money. Or by thinking instead, the labor force uses the money to get contractors to provide some of the information we are selling. Labor is the energy input. Money is a store of labor, so it is a store of energy input. It is a battery. We can take batteries from outside systems in exchange for something of value: raw materials, information, or even more money, uh, batteries if it is invested.

Each of us individual workers is our own system, and like the company, we need to profit to get along. We provide our labor (body) and thinking (mind) in exchange for money. The money is a store of labor we can now save, invest, or deploy. So if we need a gallon of gas, we exchange some of the money we earned for the labor and thought it took to extract, refine, ship, and dispense gasoline.

A person can provide either information processing (brain power) or physical labor (body power). Each one costs the person precious time and energy. The brain does for the company what it does best: it processes information, solves problems, communicates, decides,  

## Types of Waste in Service Industry {#id5884860222}

#5884860222

1. Delay on the part of customers waiting for service, for delivery, in queues for response, not arriving as promised.

1. Duplication. Having to re-enter data, repeat details on forms, copy 
information across, answer queries from several sources within the same 
organisation.

1. Unnecessary Movement. Queuing several times, lack of one-stop, poor 
ergonomics in the service encounter.

1. Unclear communication, and the wastes of seeking clarification, confusion 
over product or service use, wasting time finding a location that may result 
in misuse or duplication.

1. Incorrect inventory. Being out-of-stock, unable to get exactly what was required, substitute products or services.

1. An opportunity lost to retain or win customers, a failure to establish 
rapport, ignoring customers, unfriendliness, and rudeness.

1. Errors in the service transaction, product defects in the product-service 
bundle, lost or damaged goods.

1. Service quality errors, lack of quality in service processes.

## Task in an Ontology {#id3813060222}

#3813060222

#ontology #semantics

In thinking about an ontology, what is a task? 

- A period of time during which you are performing goal-oriented work.
- A string of words on one line of a task list.
- A recurring job to do.

For my ontology I am thinking something like this:

Task
: The idea of doing work to accomplish a goal.

Project
: A planned process composed using a sequence of tasks.

Backlog
: The list of outstanding tasks at any given time.

Project List
: A database of projects.

Project List Implementation
: The physical way the project list is recorded in the real world. It could be a whteboard, a paper list, a spreadsheet, or a SharePoint library.

## My Business {#id5895460222}

#5895460222

I just learned that the word business essentially means any activity that you do to make a profit. So I guess my "business" includes working at TECO and investing. Formerly I could have included playing band gigs.

Today I worked for about a half day, reporting to Big Bend because of an outage. The outage ended last night, so it turned out I did not really need to be there. But I worked anyway.

Julie made some non-alcoholic mimosas. They are really pretty good. I sat in the living room and listened to Tommy for maybe 30 minutes before about 9:00 pm. Joey was on his computer all night like usual. He does not tend to interact unless he wants something.

## OKRs for 2021 {#id5895660222}

## Deliberative Problem Solving Method {#id0514060222}

#0514060222

#problem-solving #critical-thinking

1. State, or "frame," the problem to be solved;
2. Identify and prioritize the relevant values, interests, and objectives;
3. Identify and resolve major uncertainties concerning the cause of the problem;
4. Generate a range of plausible solutions or alternative courses of action;
5. Predict the consequences of the courses of action and assess their impact on the relevant interests or objectives;
6. Select the course of action that optimizes the interests or objectives to be served (i.e., make a decision);
7. Implement, observe, and learn from the outcome of the decision.

## Building an Ontology using Protege {#id5891340222}

#5891340222

1. Add classes. Accept disjoint relationship default.
1. Remove unnecessary disjoint relationships.
1. Add object properties. Accept default: _not_ disjoint.
1. Give each object property a type: functional, inverse functional, symmetric, asymmetric, transitive, reflexive, and irreflexive.
1. Add individuals under the Individuals task.
1. Assign a Type to each individual.

_What is the current situation that we intend to impact?_

The reputation for performance of OPM needs to be strengthened.

_What will it look like when we achieve the desired situation or outcome?_

Upper management will approve of the performance of the department.

_What behaviors need to change for that outcome to be achieved?_

We have to satisfy the customers: the station's management, director, and upper management. 

_What knowledge or skills do people need before the behavior will change?_


_What activities need to be performed to cause the necessary learning?_


_What resources will be required to achieve the desired outcome?_

## System Diagram for Creativity {#id3913060222}

#3913060222

#system #creativity #diagram

This system diagram was proposed by Mihály Csikszentmihalyi in a book promoting a "systems approach" to creativity. But I can see other uses.

![System Diagram for Creativity](../diagrams/yed/individual-domain-field-system.png)

**Individual**
: A single person

**Discipline**
: A portion of reality studied by a field

**Field**
: The set of individuals practicing in the discipline

This is an interesting trio. Let's look at some examples from my life.

- Buddhism
    - Individual = Bhikku
    - Discipline = Dharma
    - Field = Sangha
- Structural Engineering

## Virtue Continuum {#id5878440222}

#5878440222

Julie sent this to me today, and I liked it.

![Virtue Continuum](images/virtue-continuum.jpg)

## Objectives and Decisions {#id5872600222}

#5872600222

Decisions are best understood as attempts by the decision maker to meet their objectives or goals. Assuming the decision maker wants their influence on the future to be _positive_ we might characterize their objectives as capturing their perceived idea of a better future.

Objectives represent desires that may be described by a verb and an object.

- `[Verb]` `[object]`
- Minimize effort
- Maximize safety
- Improve quality

The _set_ of objectives provides the _purpose_ for a decision, specifying what one hopes to achieve.

If this is all true, it follows that:

> Knowing one's objectives is essential to sound decision making.

### What ways were fruitful to get people to generate more objectives?

1. Providing decision makers with a category-based aid was of limited success.

1. Providing decision makers with a category-based aid to _supplement_ their original list resulted in improvement. The motivation to add more objectives or a second chance to think about objectives seems to be important.

1. Believing that additional effort (a second look) will be fruitful improved the ability to generate objectives. Informing people that research indicates most individuals can add more objectives resulted in substatial improvements.

1. Giving a target number of objectives was helpful. One way to do this is to make the simple request to list objectives, double the number they generated, and inform them that the new target is this doubled value, probably without telling them why you arrived at this number.


### What ways were not?

1. Providing sample objectives. The cause might be that exposure to certain items in a target set may inhibit recall of other items.# 2021-01-27 Estimating Probability of a Good Outcome

You have inputs, a decision-making process, the decision -- which is the output of the decision-making process, and the results, or outcome. Here are the steps you take. This is normally done informally.

1. Collect the facts. These are the inputs to the procedure.
2. Analyze the facts to make a decision. You use a procedure for this.
3. Observe the outcome of the decision.

How likely is it that what I believe to be true is really true? How good is my information? 

How likely is it that I used the right decision-making process?

How likely is it that I used the decision-making process right?

When I design a steel beam. Where are the possible sources of problems? The steel could be bad. The wrong shape could be used by the fabricator. The bolts might be defective. The loads might be higher than anticipated. There might be a calculation error. There might be an error in the code. 

We could take the inverse of these and multiply the lot of them, as long as they are independent. It would seem like a waste of time to bother estimating things with such a remote probability that it will not materially affect the coverall **conjunctive 

event. The probability does not change much when you multiply it by a microprobability: (1 - 1/1000000) = 0.999999.

What about "ordinary" risks like equipment failures and design success? Here we are definitly within the realm of something out of 100 chance being acceptable. In honor of microprobability, suppose we call this a "centiprobability." It's truly a _percent_ chance.

We don't want equipment to fail regularly. So on an hourly basis, we might be in the microprobability order of magnitude. But the failure rate over, say, 10 years might be well into the centiprobability order of magnitude. We might say OK to a 45% chance in 10 years.

Tomorrow I am interviewing for the Manager of Engineering Support Services (MESS, ironically) for the Outages and Project Management Department (O&PM) of the Energy Supply business unit of Tampa Electric Company. I'm not sure why I wrote all that, but I guess deep down I hope someone who does not know me might read this. Maybe.

Anyway, one of the questions that they will ask at the end is basically, "Why do you think we should choose you?" It's meant to give them some time to finish their ratings. But I want to answer well. And here's the rub: I am not sure I want the job. It's a lot to take on. 

I came here to write my thoughts about answering that question, but I think I should analyze the anxiety I am feeling tonight. 

## Self-Care Behaviors {#id4013060222}

#4013060222

#self-care #journal #journaling

I haven't felt a strong pull to write a journal entry lately. But ironically, when I had to do those surveys (that I never told you about until just now) every night, it was enjoyable to do. I really think I could create my own set of a few and take them every day to do some experimenting. I could model the behavior I want (right view or something) and add a measurement. It can be something real, like the number of times that day that I did $X$. Or it can be more abstract, like my subjective self-confidence rating.

If you could do this and also record everything you _do_ in a day, you could start to find correlations. Maybe whenever you talk to a friend, you are happy for two days thereafter. Then you can say, "Hey, I should go play music with Nichole. It's wholesome. It will help me, and it will help her."

OK, so let's think what a good behavior might be. It seems like it should be something social. My self-care behaviors are pretty good right now. Let's start with some communications ideas. How about these?

- Text a friend.
- Text a parent.
- See a friend in person.
- Coach someone.
- Encourage someone.
- Complement someone.
- Give positive feedback about someone.

## Department System {#id5878370222}

#5878370222

I feel like the department is the people only. The department _has_ a budget. The department _has_ facilities it uses. But the department is not these things. It is the people only. They are the only actors. They are purposeful elements of the system. If I ever want to diagram the department system, it would simply be the people. In fact, I could use the organization chart. The relationship in the hierarchy would be something like, "reports to" and "directs" in the other direction.

## KB {#id5889580222}

#5889580222

For years I've had this "KB" project which is essentially a set of PDFs. What if I made this into a formal ontology? Individuals would include the PDFs, and any other medium of knowledge capture and retrieval, such as physical books, audio recordings, and videos.

## Buddhist Path {#id5873710222}

#5873710222

This idea would be to create an ontology to model the concepts of the Buddhist path. This would include terms like Buddha, dharma, Noble Eightfold Path, Four Noble Truths, and so on.


## Music {#id5866920222}

#5866920222

This ontology idea is to capture my musical life: bands, gigs, performances, instruments, practice, etc. It would answer the question, "How can I best actualize my musician identity?"

## My Life {#id5887580222}

#5887580222

This would be much more ambitious than the ideas above. This ontology would answer big questions like:

1. What is the best way to spend my time?
1. How much exercise do I need?
1. What should I eat and drink?
1. What are my values?
1. How do I best pursue my values?
1. What actions are wholesome?
1. Are habits better than goals and OKRs?
1. How do I build habits?
1. How do I achieve enlightenment?

It could even be the culimination of several smaller ontologies rolled into one. How about something like:

- My Musical Life
- My Inner Life
- My Personal Life
- My Spiritual Life
- My Work Life
- My Social Life

Or it could be self-actualization type ontologies, each one named after an identiy I want to cultivate.

- Social Person
    - Husband
    - Friend
- Engineer
- Musician
- Lifelong Learner
- Teacher

Here are some terms and ideas.

- A person spends time on an activity.
- An activity is when we employ our body and mind to do something.
- A person has things they value in life.
- An objective is a short-term state of affairs derived from values and circumstances.
- Wellness includes physical health and mental health.
- Wholesome is an adjective meaning "conducive to or indicative of good health or well-being."
- A habit is an activity you regularly engage in without having to summon up motivation.

Wholesome activities is the set of activities conducive to desired states of physical health, mental health, social status, 


## The Eight Worldly Conditions {#id5890380222}

#5890380222

1. Gain 
1. Loss
1. Praise 
1. Blame
1. Good Reputation 
1. Bad Reputation
1. Pleasure 
1. Pain

We can use these to help us define wholesome and unwholesome activities.

- A wholesome activity leads away from loss, blame, bad reputation, and pain.
- A wholesome activity leads toward gain, praise, good reputation, and pleasure.
- An un wholesome activity leads toward from loss, blame, bad reputation, and - pain.
- An unwholesome activity leads away from gain, praise, good reputation, and pleasure.

The law of karma is what connects wholesome actions to positive outsomes.

- Being - Existing without doing or training.
- Training - Getting better at doing something.
- Doing - Performing what we have trained to do.
- Reflecting - Thinking about all the above.

## JoeKB Ontology {#id5882960222}

#5882960222

I am going to make my ontology the JoeKB Ontology. It think it will be a good starting point. 

### Domain and Scope

The domain for this ontology includes the following portions of the world:
- Things owned by Joe Legner.
- Things that are computer files of books or book-like works.
- Things that are physical books.

The scope should include the content, categorization, tagging, search, and retrieval of said things, including the physical books. Retrieval of the physical books will require some kind of notions of location in the real world. We might start with address, building, room, and location within room as a basic system.

It should be able to handle the same computer file in multiple locations.

It sould be able to handle:
- Multiple copies of the same computer file.
- Multiple copies of the same work in physical book format and computer file format.

It will probably need to be populated programatically somehow, by looking at Metadata in PDF files or looking up book metadata online using ISBN or something.

### Competency Questions

1. What PDF files do I have related to engineering?
1. What PDF files do I have related to structural engineering?
1. What PDF files do I have related to structural steel engineering?
1. Where should new information go?

## SQLite and Python {#id5861870222}

#5861870222

I have this vague idea that I should get really good at using SQLite and Python together. I have looked at things like SQLAlchemy, and other things like Django ORM, but none of them really do exactly what I want them to do. That gives me this harebrained idea of writing my own library. But I don't think I want to commit to something like that. But just for fun, what if I brainstorm what it might look like if it was being used and worked well?

It should be dead simple to connect to the database.

```python
>>> from xxx import Database
>>> db = Database("opm.sqlite3")
>>> db.tables()
["deliverable", "deliverable_process", "process", "process_deliverable"]
```

A record should be its own class of the same name, but capitalized.

```python
>>> for record in db["deliverable"]:
...     print(type(record))
Deliverable
```
We could do this with the database so it always closes.

```python
>>> with Database("opm.sqlite3") as db:
...      pass
```

The other class in many-to-many relations should be easy to access.

```python
>>> deliverable = db["deliverable"][0]   # Returns first record
>>> print(deliverable)
"Support Request"
>>> print(deliverable.processes)
(("Onboarding Process", 0),}
```

Note how the processes are returned as a tuple of tuples. This is because each many-to-many table (here `deliverable_process`) can add data. So we need more than just the other instance of Process. We need the data, too, and we can provide it in the tuple.

```python
with Database("opm.sqlite3") as db:
    with db["deliverable"] as table:
        for record in table:
            print(record)
```

What would it look like in a Jinja2 scenario?

```python
db = Database("opm.sqlite3"),
context = {
    "deliverables"  : db["deliverable"],
    "processes"     : db["process"],
    "roles"         : db["roles"],
}
```

``` markdown

## Note, this is Markdown syntax. {#id2690510222}

#2690510222

{% for d in deliverables %}
# {{ d.name }}

{% if d.deliverable_process %}
Deliverable {{d.name}} is an input to these processes:
{% for process in d.deliverable_process %}
- {{process.name}} {% if d.is_trigger(process) %}(trigger){% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if d.process_deliverable %}
Deliverable {{d.name}} is output from these processes:
{% for process in d.deliverable_process %}
- {{process.name}}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if d.role_deliverable %}
These roles are involved in the production of deliverable {{d.name}}:
{% for role in d.role_deliverable %}
{{role.name}} is {{role.role_deliverable.raci_name}} for {{d.name}}
{% endfor %}

## Fact {#id5869580222}

#5869580222

1. Incident, act, event, or circumstance. A fact is something that has already been done or an action in process. It is an event that has definitely and actually taken place, and is distinguishable from a suspicion, innuendo, or supposition. A fact is a truth as opposed to fiction or mistake. A Question of Fact in litigation is concerned with what actually took place. During a trial, questions of fact are generally left for the jury to determine after each opposing side has presented its case. By contrast, a Question of Law is ordinarily decided by a judge, who must deal with applicable legal rules and principles that affect what transpired.

1. An actual thing or happening, which must be proved at trial by presentation of evidence and which is evaluated by the finder of fact (a jury in a jury trial, or by the judge if he/she sits without a jury).

1. An event, occurrence or state of affairs known to have happened; to be distinguished from opinion or law. Facts can however be found proven in legal proceedings where they may or may not have actually happened. Facts may also be inferred from other facts.

1. Something that has actual existence : a matter of objective reality

1. Any of the circumstances of a case that exist or are alleged to exist in reality : a thing whose actual occurrence or existence is to be determined by the evidence presented at trial.

FACT. An action; a thing done. It is either simple or compound.

2. A fact is simple when it expresses a purely material act unconnected with any moral qualification; for example, to say Peter went into his house, is to express a simple fact. A compound fact contains the materiality of the act, and the qualification which that act has in its connexion with morals and, the law. To say, then, that Peter has stolen a horse, is to express a compound fact; for the fact of stealing, expresses at the same time, the material fact of taking the horse, and of taking him with the guilty intention of depriving the owner of his property and appropriating it to his own use; which is a violation of the law of property.

3. Fact. is also put in opposition to law; in every case which has to be tried there are facts to be established, and the law which bears on those facts.

4. Facts are also to be considered as material or immaterial. Material facts are those which are essential to the right of action or defence, and therefore of the substance of the one or the other - these must always be proved; or immaterial, which are those not essential to the cause of action these need not be proved. 3 Bouv. Inst. n. 3150-53.

5. Facts are generally determined by a jury,; but there are many facts, which, not being the principal matters in issue, may be decided by the court; such, for example, whether a subpoena has or has not been served; whether a party has or has not been summoned, &c. As to pleading material facts, see Gould. Pl. c. 3, s. 28. As to quality of facts proved, see 3 Bouv. Inst. n. 3150. Vide Eng. Ece. R. 401-2, and the article Circumstances.# 2021-06-30 Hard Rain

Today around 3:00 or 3:30 it rained, hard, at Big Bend Station. The ditches were all running. The parking lot was so flooded that the water went over top of my shoes as I got in my car to go home.

In related weather news, the hurricane season is just now starting to get going. There are some disturbances in the Cape Verde pattern that they are watching.

## Decision-Making Terms {#id0814060222}

#0814060222

#decision-making #ontology

Here are a few terms and relations between terms to whet one's appetite for learning about decision-making. The first block quotes are taken from "An Overview of Decision Theory."

> **Decision theory 

deals with **situations 

in which one or more **actors 

must make **choices 

among given **alternatives**. These alternatives may be courses of action to be undertaken, objects to possess, amounts of money to pay for them, etc. They mayaiso be 'what to believe'. For instance, a jury deliberating on the guilt or innocence of a defendant must eventually choose collectively between 'believing that the defendant is guilty' and 'believing that he is innocent'.

> **Choice 

and **freedom of choice 

are primitive (not further analyzable) terms and the assumption that such freedom exists is fundamental in decision theory.

> Furthermore, decision theory is based on an assumption that each choice (decision) entails consequences called **outcomes 

and that each of the actors making the decisions has **preferences 

for the different outcomes. It is not assumed that an actor necessarily has full **knowledge 

of just what those consequences will be; but it is assumed that an actor envisages at least some of them, and it is these envisaged consequences that he prefers to varying degrees. The extent and the precision of an actor's knowledge (or presumed knowledge) of the consequences is specified in a particular model of a **decision situation**.

Consequences may involve **gains 

or **losses**.

> In order to discuss a **decision situation 

with the view of understanding it better, the situation must be circumscribed. Specification of what is to be assumed or taken into account amounts to formulating a **model**. Decision theory, like any other theory, considers **models of situations 

rather than situations in all their complexities and ramifications.

> A **descriptive decision theory 

purports to deal with questions pertaining to how people behave in given choice situations. It raises questions about what we need to know in order successfully to predict their behaviour in such situations. A **normative theory 

poses questions of a different sort, namely, how people *ought to* behave in given decision situations; also how the individual preferences of the actors can be reconciled with their collective interests (if any).

> The branch of normative decision theory dealing with situations involving more than one actor constitutes the **theory of games**. the distinction between games involving exactly two actors, now called **players 

(two-person games) and those involving more than two ($n$-person games) is an important one, because $n$-person games may involve the formation of **coalitions**.

> The possibility of forming coalitions is the essential feature of the **cooperative game**. Members of coalition **cooperate 

in the sense that they coordinate their strategies while they pursue a **common goal**. This cooperation makes sense only ifthe members of a coalition have a **common goal**. This is the case if they are able to achieve more by coordinating their choices than by playing independently. It is assumed in the theory of the cooperative game that the **coordination of choices 

is achieved by effecting **agreements 

and that these agreements are **enforceable**. The competitive aspect of an n-person cooperative game ($n > 2$) is manifested in the opposition between the interests of one coalition and those of other coalitions. At times, all of the $n$ players may form the **grand coalition**.

> The bargaining power of a player can be manifested in two ways: (1) by his **threat leverage 

and (2) by his **value 

to the particular coalitions he can join.

Thus a player can either be a threat or an ally. Doesn't this ring true in real life, especially work life with all its political machinations?

> The player can demand a larger share of \[the\] joint gain by threatemng to withdraw cooperation, that is, to ehoose some alternative other than that preseribed to hirn, resulting in a loss to others (as weIl as, generally, to hirnself). The relative threat leverage of the players is measured by the **losses entailed**. Games in whieh the threat leverages of the players are of central interest are called **bargaining games**.

> The **value 

of a player to a **coalition 

is reflected in the extent to which he can by joining it **increase the payoff 

the coalition can expect to get if it has to play against the remaining players, also in coalition. In particular, in making a claim for a share of the joint payoff of the grand coalition, the player can bolster his claim by pointing out what he could gain if he (and perhaps some others) **broke away 

from the grand coalition to form one of their own.

## Leah {#id5882760222}

#5882760222

Leah came to Julie's gig tonight! It was a fun surprise to see her. I was sitting at a table with Tiffanie and her friends, and there was Leah coming around the corner. She ended up coming over to the house after the show and left super late like 3:15 am. 

## Mindfulness Experiment {#id2814060222}

#2814060222

#mindfulness #meditation

One day on my way home, I did a spontaneous and unplanned mindfulness experiement. Recently, I have been listening to Joseph Goldstein talk about using passive voice for mental noting. That must have influenced me to perform this little mental experiment while I was driving.

Recently, I have been listening to Joseph Goldstein talk about using passive voice for mental noting. That must have influenced me to perform this little mental experiment while I was driving.

On the way home, I began mentally noting what was happening in a passive voice. They seem to have a calming influence on me. The last few days, I have felt a little unsettled about the world. I've had that kind of vague, "something is not right" feeling in my gut. Doing this thought experiment kind of made that fade for a while. Here are some examples of the phrases I said out loud quietly to myself:

- "Feeling acceleration, pressure increase."

- "Recognizing sign, words, license plate."

- "Recognizing red lights. Remembering brake lights. Thinking of risk."

- "Seeing mailbox and knowing of the seeing."

- "Pedal vibrating and knowing of vibrating."

- "Sloth and torpor."

- "Sensation; itching in eyebrow. Urge to scratch. Allowing scratching to occur. Scratching. Feeling of urge fading."

I went on and on. It was great fun, and my thoughts turned toward Julie and the kids. Maybe they can try it with me someday.

> Noticing "I" was used ten times here!

## Learning Cycle {#id5871670222}

#5871670222

Maybe I should think about how I learn. I'm talking about "book learning" here. What am I trying to do when I learn? Is it not the following?

1. Acquire idea about a known domain.

1. Acquire a new domain to explore.

1. Make a new connection between two concepts in an existing domain.

We can integrate this into my existing ontology knowledge. Remember that things naturally fall into:

1. Individuals

1. Classes

1. Relations

Now look at these two lists. They line up perfectly. If an "idea" is an individual, a "domain" is a class, and a "connection" is a relation, we see the similarity.

How do I spend my time when I'm trying to learn? Sometimes I read something, deeply. I take the time to study it and integrate the knowledge into my system as I go, painstakingly. I see this as increasing the depth of my knowledge. Other times I just wander. I might look up books by subject, browse weird WikiPedia sites, skim existing PDFs I have, or whatever. And often I find something this way. But when I find something, it's usually a shallower understanding. This is more like expanding the scope of my knowledge without increasing the depth. The third thing you might say I do is reflect, that is to ponder what I know now without going out to read what others have written. This seems to strengthen the connections between existing ideas I know about. This journal entry is a good example. I was sitting out in the backyard in a chair, when I felt urged to come and start writing this. I felt an urge to explore _how_ I, Joe Legner, personally acquire knowledge. And darn it if there was not immediately an interesting metaphor between my learning styles and ontologies. I made a connection between two domains today.

In fact, the concept of a metaphor seems important. What if our brain is a network of neurons that get strengthened from use. They like making connections between patterns. They see a pattern in the environment which triggers ideas in the mind. That set of ideas brought out by the environment might also be recognized as a pattern of its own, causing other ideas in the network to light up. Connections get strengthened by using them when thinking.

What about these three dimensions of knowledge?

- **Breadth 

- How many domains I can talk about with some authority.

- **Depth 

- How deep the authority goes in each domain.

- **Strength 

- How effortless is the knowledge to access. How good am I at retrieving it.

What does a domain seem to include?

- That set of concepts currently held in the brains of individuals working in the field.

- Representations of all the domain's concepts in the form of representational artifacts: books, journal articles, video recordings, audio recordings, and other written and graphical artifacts of all kinds that can be used as representations of ideas.

- A social network which includes the was for individuals in the field to talk to each other and produce, store, maintain, and find the representational artifacts that record the domain's stored knowledge.

This is probably an appropriate time to go poke around in the world of cognitive science. The CRUM or Computational-Representational Understanding of the Mind seems like it has the potential to collect all these ideas into a single domain: a domain where mind and science intersect.

## The Stress Management Handbook {#id5411120222}

#5411120222

#book #stress

I've been reading the first part of a book called _The Stress Management Handbook_, by Eva Selhub, M.D. I did so much that I ordered one so I can read it to Joey. I think he would really benefit from it.

I was awfully disillusioned with studying Spanish, among other things. Today I felt a little more positive. I think it is when I get tired that I get down like that. I should notice when I'm sleepy and keep that in mind through the day so I don't do something stupid.

Anyway this book has a list of words that you can use to sort of examine your emotions at a particular point in time. I thought the list was pretty useful, so here it is.

![Word Choices to Examine Emotions at the Moment](images/word-choices.png)

Size in the book says to think of a time when you were angry, and then pick out words from the list. After that, divide them into positive and negative columns, ostensibly to see that the anger causes negative emotions to arise. In other words, the author expects you to have more words in the negative column then in the positive column. I did, when I did it in my head.

The author invites us to investigate our emotions deeply and look for both the root causes and the patterns that exist, historically. I guess the thing that really stands out is my desire not to be criticized. I get angry and defensive when somebody questions me on something that I am confident about. I don't like people to go against my recommendation, because I hold myself in such high esteem, that I think I could not possibly be wrong about it. _They_ are! It might be childhood memories of my mom and her sharp tongue. It came out a little bit while we were up in Illinois this past week. She just has a mean and hurtful side to her that is not very deeply hidden. It's ironic, because it's like there are two of her. One is this kindly grandma type, but underneath is this little hurtful bitch. Little hurtful bitch doesn't come out very often, thankfully. That's probably because I have adapted my behavior over the years. I have avoided these hurtful little bitch. In the past it was probably because I couldn't handle the pain. Now I think I am a little more wise and worldly maybe? Did things a little better now maybe? 

Why do I so dislike receiving criticism? It feels painful. I don't like others to disapprove of my performance. I want to be perfect, and I want people all to think I'm perfect.

## Types of Knowledge {#id4213060222}

#4213060222

#knowledge #army #ontology

I liked this list of the four types of knowledge from [army manual TP350-70-14](https://adminpubs.tradoc.army.mil/pamphlets/TP350-70-14.pdf).

The following are the four types of knowledge:

(a) Factual knowledge (terminology, specific details, and elements).

(b) Conceptual knowledge (classifications, categories, principles,generalizations, theories, models, and structures).

(c) Procedural knowledge (subject-specific skills and algorithms, subject-specific techniques and methods, and criteria for determining when to use appropriate procedures).

(d) Metacognitive knowledge (strategic knowledge, knowledge about cognitive tasks including appropriate contextual and conditional knowledge, and self-knowledge).

# Model-View-Controller (MVC)

This code snippet really makes the MVC concept clear to me.

```python
class Controller():

    def __init__(self):
        self.model = Model()                # create a new model
        self.view = View()                  # create a new view

    def handle(self, request):
        data = self.model.get_data(request) # get the data
        self.view.update(data)              # update the view
```

The controller seems to (1) own the model, (2) have a connection to the view, and (3) play the role of receiving and processing requests. It gets the data from the model, and then updates the view.

## Micro-Goals Revisited {#id5872320222}

#5872320222

I was thinking about the fact that I get a boost in mood whenever I do something wholesome. If I help someone or send my mother a kind text message, I feel good about it. It's got to be from a wholesome motivation. If I simultaneously feel compassion when I do it, it boosts my self-opinion. If something reinforces my self-belief, I should do it. In fact, if I did just some minimal amount of effort toward an area of self-actualization, I would be happy with myself. This, together with forgiving my frequent shortcomings, should be sufficient to sustain some degree of contentedness. 

What if I did those wholesome activities daily, relentlessly, but without judging myself for the quantity or even quality of the activity? I just do not break the chain, even for a day, exercising. It might be a complete workout when I'm feeling energized and positive. It might be a long walk on a Sunday. It might be just picking up a dumbbell and doing some curls. It just needs to be time spent purposefully exercising.

Maybe I could do this by time-based wholesome micro-goals. Each micro-goal is just to spend _time_, no matter how small a measure of it, doing something _wholesome_. The first example of a wholesome activity is exercise. Let me brainstorm some others that might be candidates.

1. Spend time outside. Stretch: spend time in nature.
1. Spend time exercising. Stretch: do an entire workout.
1. Text a friend, colleague, or family member something wholesome. Stretch: meet up with a friend.
1. Help someone else. Stretch: do some charitable work or give to a charity.
1. Play music. Stretch: play out somewhere.
1. Learn something. Study.
1. Discover something new. Explore, outside, inside, or even online. Stretch: add an Anki card.
1. Celebrate something that happened today, no matter how big or small.


## I Think Too Fast {#id5895350222}

#5895350222

I have a powerful, quick brain. I am starting to realize I think faster than most people around me, at least when I am "on." The other day, a guy at work, who I already consider very bright, stopped a conversation and said, "Joe, I don't think I think as fast as you." This is a guy who recently recounted a story where he made someone else feel stupid in a meeting. That occasion was even inadvertent. He was smart enough that his normal conversation made someone else feel stupid, and I am smart enough that my normal conversation makes him feel slower than me. My usual disclaimer applies: I am not saying this to stroke my ego. I'm saying it as a lesson to my future self. Keep this in mind, and it will help you understand and relate to people better. You might want to slow down, be patient with others, let them take the time they need to understand something. You might need to plant seeds and water them to get something to grow. For the smarter folks, you might just lead them through the steps in your reasoning. For the very smart folks, you can lead them through leading _you_ through _their_ reasoning.

## PowerPoint Tips {#id2914060222}

#2914060222

#powerpoint #presentation

PowerPoint slides should be sparse. If the idea is to convey information to the audience, then speaking is a much more natural and fast way to do so. I can speak 150 words per minute. How many words per minute can you get reading slides? And honestly how much reading comprehension can you expect while you are also listening to someone speak to you? The ideal slide deck for me seems like it would consist of a lot of sparse slides with just a couple words or a picture, sprinkled with slides displaying tabular data.

Another not so bad idea might be to just read verbatim a pre-written report over that sparse slide deck. That way you do not make any mistakes. But the listener gets to passively receive the story from you without having to exert themselves to read it. Listening is easier than reading.

I could open a presentation with this:

> Ladies and gentlemen. My presentation is going to be a little unorthodox. I call it a lean presentation. I have a few sparse slides with talking points, pictures, or tabular data, and I will just talk over them. I can speak around 150 words per minute. That's a lot faster than you can read, and listening is easier than reading. Speech has better information density than reading, listening takes less effort than reading, and you can interrupt me and ask questions. It is interactive.

## Probability of God {#id5861780222}

#5861780222

Let $G$ be the event "God exists." If I have no idea either way if it is true, I would assign a probability of 1/2.

$$P(G) = 1/2 = 0.5$$

Now let us look at Bayes Theorem which says:

$$P(A|B) = \dfrac{ P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$

Let's rename the variables. We will let $A=G$ and $B=E$ where $G$ still means "God exists" and $E$ means "evidence." Bayes Theorem becomes:

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ P(E|G) P(G)}{P(E)}$$

$P(A|B)$ becomes $P(G|E)$ which means, "Probability God exists given evidence $E$." $P(E)$ means "the probability of evidence $E$." $P(E|G)$ then means "the probability of evidence $E$ if God exists."

We will re-write the equation in the form for a binary variable, because there are only two options. Either God exists $G$ or God does not exist $\neg G$.

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ P(E|G)P(G) }{ P(E|G)P(G) + P(E|\neg G)P(\neg G)} $$

OK, now what would I assign for the variables on the right-hand side? We already "know" that $P(G) = 1/2$. 

What is the probability of a miracle if God exists, $P(E|G)$? If God exists, I would have no idea what he would do, so I have to assign $P(E|G) = 1/2$, meaning I am indifferent to whether or not he would perform a miracle if he existed.

What is the probability of a miracle if God did not exist, $P(E|\neg G)$? Here I would say that the proability is infintessimally small, say 1/1000000. 

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ 1/2 \times 1/2 }{ 1/2 \times 1/2 + 1/1000000 \times 1/2 } = 500000/500001 =  0.999998$$

This is virtual certainty, which is to be expected. If a _real_ miracle happens, we can be damn shure that God exists, or $G$.

Let's look at the probability of a miracle, $P(E)$. 

## My Top 5 Books to Reread {#id5872660222}

#5872660222

Nabakov once said:

> Curiously enough, one cannot read a book; one can only reread it.

My newest wacky idea just now is that I should have a core of, say 5 books that I re-read reguarly. The should contain a lot of information that is directly useful to me. Therefore, something general is better than something specific. They should be something either "timeless" or at least "state-of-the-art." They should be normative as well as informative.

A third worthy subject would be something on the lines of:

1. Arguing
1. Buddhism
1. Critical thinking
1. Engineering
1. Enlightenment
1. Ethics
1. Integrity
1. Law
1. Leadership
1. Logic
1. Math
1. Mindfulness
1. Problem-solving
1. Rationalism
1. Reasoning
1. Writing

There should be one book with subject matter useful to one of the types of "self" that I contain.

1. Physical self (B for Body)
1. Emotional self
1. Ethical self 
1. Financial self
1. Social self

Or maybe these dimensions are better:

1. Personal
1. Interpersonal
1. Social
1. Business
1. Professional

Or the six pursuits of man:

1. Aesthetic
1. Moral
1. Ethical
1. Scientific
1. Economic
1. Political

Here are the candidates that come to mind so far. 

1. _A Primer of Probability Logic_ by Ernest W. Adams.
1. _7 Habtis of Highly Effective People_ by Steven Covey.
1. _An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_ by David Hume.
1. _Extreme Ownership_ by Jocko Wilnic.
1. _The God Delusion_ by Richard Dawkins.
1. _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahneman.
1. _Lying_ by Sam Harris.

| I wanted to write you a song
| One filled with meaning in every part
| To shine a light into the corner
| Of this old, dusty heart
| 
| It would be filled with love so pure
| It would say what you wanted to hear
| And put a smile on the lips
| I hold so dear
| 
| But I'm not a writer
| I'm just a boy

| I'm the little boy that wants to hold your hand
| To run on the beach and fall in the sand
| Skipping stones

| I wanted to write you a song
| I want to write you a song
| Please forgive me
| I don't have it in me
| I wish I could write you your love song

| The pain is so hard
| Please let me go where you are

## My Noble Eightfold Path {#id5875630222}

#5875630222

**Right View**
: _Seeing things the way they really are_.
: I think I am better at this now than any time in my life.
: By small degrees, I am getting better at seeing through the bullshit and sympathizing with people.

**Right Intention**
: _Intending to renounce my demons, intending to have good-will toward my fellow beings, and having compassion for myself and other beings_.
: I have a pretty good score here. My demons are persistent, but I feel like I am wearing them down. Marijuana is an improvement from alcohol, for example. But why stop there?

**Right Speech**
: _Speaking with kindness and compassion_.
: I am doing better in this department, too. I do make a conscious effort not to speak harshly. I notice when I am speaking harshly. 


**Right Action**
: _Not lying, cheating, stealing, and things like that_.
: I give myself high marks for the negative values here: not lying, for example. Any kind of positive value, like charity or generosity, is not a strong point for me. 

**Right Livelihood**
: _Earning your living in an ethical and non-harming way_.
: I do this. I think my profession is an honorable one. I don't really lie or cheat to get ahead. I truly want to be promoted because I am the best. High marks for this one.

**Right Effort**
: _Putting forth effort to improve oneself in accordance with the Eightfold Noble Path_.
: I maybe get a B or C here. I do like to listen to Joseph Goldstein and even meditate a bit. I am always trying to get better. But I lack some willpower to reduce some unwholesome thoughts.

**Right Mindfulness**
: _The awareness that arises from paying attention, in the present moment, on purpose, and without judgment_.
: One area I need to work on here is the "without judgment" part. I am often judgmental toward myself and others, especially Julie. 

**Right Concentration**
: _Practicing control of directed or choiceless awareness to achieve deeper levels of insight into reality and your inner life. Meditation practice_.
: I do try. It's not as much as it probably should be for my spiritual development and insight. Maybe as I get wiser, I will get more enthusiastic about it.

## Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge {#id0914060222}

#0914060222

#writing #process

That heading, my friends, is a asyndeton -- the purposeful omission of conjunctions. But this is not what I am here for.

I came across some interesting writing advice from a book called _Legal writing in Plain English_ by Bryan Garner. 

The book mentions a method Dr. Betty Sue Flowers of the University of Texas developed: the Madman, the Architect, the Carpenter, and the Judge.

The job of the Madman is to generate ideas. This means letting ideas flow about what you want to write about. The Judge must be kept away so the Madman can be uninhibited.

The Architect then comes in and organizes the ideas into an outline. This may be done non-linearly first, but the final deliverable from the Architect is the outline. The Judge must be kept away so the Architect can try out ideas freely.

It is important not to let the Judge interfere with the work of the Madman, the Architect, or the Carpenter. Keep the Judge away. He will delay the work of the Carpenter. He can wait.

## Journal of the Madman {#id5890870222}

#5890870222

It dawned on me that my journal belongs to the Madman. It is full of more or less disconnected ideas, serially written. Each one has enough information to remind me what it was about, but not excess detail. Each entry could be elaborated.

My flow should go like this:

- Work
- Meditate
- Daydream
- Explore
- Write an entry in this journal
- Add one or more Anki cards from the entry

## Supermemo Guy {#id5885710222}

#5885710222

I enjoy the writing of Supermemo Guy. Supermemo Guy is the author of the Anki predecessor, supermemo. Seems to be some kind of a eccentric creative genius. He writes all these articles on his wiki. He seems to maybe have some expertise in the field of learning and memory.


## Incremental Reading {#id5870480222}

#5870480222

What I have been doing for the past year and a half or two has a name. It is called "incremental reading." There is WikiPedia page on it.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading>

I read this, and I was like, "I do this now!" My process is as follows:

1. Read some random piece about a subject I am interested in at that moment. It may be a book or article or even a YouTube Video or a Podcast.

2. Spot some nuggets of wisdom in it.

3. Create Anki cards and add them to one of my many decks.

4. Study the Anki cards every day.

I am a little shocked at the moment. It's good that my method has a name and was invented by that weird Piotor character. The other day, I kind of skimmed his lenthy wiki article on incremental reading and was left confused about what it was. I even tried to watch him do it in realtime on a YouTube video. But I was not concentrating enough to see it clearly. Today I read the WikiPedia page, and now I get it.

## Prolog {#id4613060222}

#4613060222

#prolog #programming #computer #software #language #logic

For no reason I suddenly got interested in Prolog. I've been reading about it and making Anki cards for several hours today. It all started when I was sort of daydreaming and brainstorming on the subject of "ideals" for my Ideal-Seeking System idea. Anyway, this is what I wrote on an Apple note.

| Each claim agrees with that which is. 
| Each pair of claims agree. 
| Each action promotes well being. 
| Each agent knows that which is. 
| Each agent knows what promotes well being. 
| Each being is respected. 
| Each action is kind. 
| Each being is an end unto itself. 
| 
| Ideals are states of affairs. 
| Means are ways to reach ideals. 
| Actions apply means. 
| Agents perform actions. 
| Agents are beings.
| Skillful actions promote well being.
| Kindness promotes well being. 
| Agents have minds. 
| Minds produce thoughts. 
| 
| Free time means going where I am pulled. # 2021-09-12 More Prolog

```prolog
/* Facts in the form of simple atoms */
joe.
julie.
tommy.
joey.

/* Facts */
female(julie).
male(joe).
male(joey).
male(tommy).
parent(joe, joey).
parent(joe, tommy).
parent(julie, joey).
parent(julie, tommy).

/* Rules */
mother(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), female(X).
father(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), male(X).
son(X, Y):- parent(Y, X), male(X).
daughter(X, Y):- parent(Y, X), female(X).
```

Let's explain the first rule: `mother(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), female(X).`

This rule means "`X` is the mother of `Y` if `X` is the parent of `Y` and `X` is female". Given this rule, this would evaluate as true: `mother(julie, tommy).`

## Rust Guessing Game {#id5885670222}

#5885670222

Today I did the Rust guessing game programming chapter. Here is my program.

```rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    let mut guesses = 0;

    loop {
        guesses = guesses + 1;
        
        println!("I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.");
        println!("Enter guess #{}", guesses);

        let mut guess = String::new();

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");

        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You won in {} guesses!", guesses);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I even made an improvement, which was to include the guest number when the question is asked, and to say how many guesses they won in.

## On Dictation {#id5899710222}

#5899710222

The best kind of writing would be writing that sounds good when it's read out loud. Speech is our normal way of communication. Reading is the newcomer. Good writing it would seem would sound like someone is speaking to you. The writer is speaking to you. So, what I'm getting at, is that I should probably speak my text more often. I could use my dictation more, not only because of this, but because I can type faster this way. I can easily get a lot of thoughts down without tearing out my fingers. Then I can come back later and put the finishing touches on it during the edit phase. You know, the Judge character.

I am going to wait five minutes, and then edit that paragraph.

The best kind of writing sounds good when it's read out loud. Think about it. When I read something, I often read it "out loud" to myself, in my head. By writing things that sound like speech, we are utiziling the innate machinery dedicated to speech that effortly recognizes, parses, conjugates, and finds the meaning of spoken speech. 

I should use dictation more.

I can easily get a lot of thoughts down without tiring out out my fingers. That gets me the first draft. After that, during the editing phase, I can use the keyboard to apply the finishing touches, for accuracy.

## Rust Integers {#id5895880222}

#5895880222

| Signed integers in Rust: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, and `i128`.
| Unsigned integers in Rust: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, and `u128`.

The default integer type is `i32`.

When defining variables, long integers can be split up with underscores. The underscore is ignored.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let x = 101_000;
    let y = 101000;
    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
}
```

This results in:

```
Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.97s
    Running `target/debug/playground`
Hello, world!
x = 101000, y = 101000
```

## Rust Floating Types {#id5877620222}

#5877620222

The two floating types are `f32` and `f64`. `f64` is the default type, because because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision.

Here’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:

`Filename: src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}

```

## Some Thoughts on Scenario Ontology {#id5869510222}

| C | Scenario C1 | Scenario C2 |

## Writing to a Specific Person {#id5881530222}

#5881530222

I read this in the _HBR Guide to Better Business Writing_ by Bryan A. Garner. Write to a specific person in your audience. Think about who is in your audience. I mean individual people that you know in the world. Then pick one of them who is both smart and a generalist, not a specialist. We would say that they do not have more specialized knowledge than the average member of the audience.

The point is to get it down to an individual person that you know in the real world, not some vague "type" of person. 

For structural engineering issues, I could pick a mechanical engineer that I know. I could hone in on the mechanical engineers I know at TECO. But eventually I should narrow it down to one person. That way I can visualize them reading and interpreting it as I go.

What about Dru Latchman? She is pretty smart, and she has a lot of experience. She would probably understand the basics. Writing to her, I would avoid technical jargon like "cantilever". Then again, she might know that word. I could include it in parenthesis to acknowledge that possibility.

I would not write to Sam DeCubellis. He is too crazy. Maybe Brit Johnston would work. He is not particularly good at engineering, but that's average among the engineering managers. The thing is: I at least know him pretty well. I think he would work out better than Bob Bertig.

If I did something like this, I could do away with some formality. 

> The purpose of this report is to summarize the findings of the assessment performed by the structural engineering team.

Could be written like this if I was writing directly to Brit Johnston:

> The structural engineering team assessed the structure, and this report summarizes their findings.

That has the feel of action and result, and it communicates all the information important to state the purpose to the reader.

## Read Article about Conditionalization {#id5862960222}

#5862960222

This is the article: <https://philosophy.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Proper-Formulation-website.pdf>

> "The central notion of Bayesian decision theory is credence (a.k.a. degree of belief, a.k.a. subjective probability)."

I like credence as a synonym for degree of belief and subjective probability.

> "Bayesians study an idealized agent who attaches credences to propositions."

This introduces some terms:
- agent
- credence
- proposition

This article does a good job introducing Bayesian decision making. 

> "Imagine a person whose state of uncertainty is characterized by a 'prior' probability P0 ..., and who is not dogmatic about x, so that 1 > P0(x) > 0."

We have a mathematical definition of _dogmatism_ in the context of Baysian decision-making:

$$ P(x) = 1 \implies \text{ agent is dogmatic} $$

> "Factive formulations assume that the conditioning proposition is true. Non-factive formulations allow that the conditioning proposition may be false."

These are two new terms:
- factive
- non-factive

Consider this:

$$P(E|E) = 1$$

If $E$ is certain, than we must assign credence 1 to $E$. 

> "All ordinary channels of epistemic justification -- - including perception, testimony, memory, introspection, and a priori reasoning --- are subject to error."

This is good. I might want to make this an Anki card.

## Idleness {#id5881900222}

#5881900222

The opposite of work is idleness. 

## Going To {#id5892660222}

#5892660222

I was thinking about competency questions as project objectives. Like these:

- Is it going to work?
- Is it going to fit?
- Is it going to provide a benefit?

The answers to these are something like:

- It is going to work.
- It is going to fit.
- It is going to provide benefits.
- It is going to prevent losses.

This formulation of the sentence $X$ is "going to" $Y$ led me to a small insight. These would be very strongly worded objectives for a project. We can just substitue part of the scope into the statement for "it":

- The new system is going to work.
- The new system is going to fit.
- The new system is going to provide benefits.
- The new system is going to prevent losses.

_going to_ is a prediction of the way things will be in a time yet to come. It supposes we are on the path or _going toward_ this future state. But what state of affairs?

The last part after "to" is the desired end state, when married with the subject "the new system". What I mean is the desired end state is the state of affairs where _the new system_ exists and it is doing _work_. We might simply say, "the new system works" is the target end state. 

Good writing displays facts. Bad writing displays itself.

## Ridiculously Good Writing {#id5892830222}

#5892830222

| **Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 75**
| LXXV. On the Diseases of the Soul

> You have been complaining that my letters to you are rather carelessly written. Now who talks carefully unless he also desires to talk affectedly?[1] I prefer that my letters should be just what my conversation[2] would be if you and I were sitting in one another's company or taking walks together, – spontaneous and easy; for my letters have nothing strained or artificial about them. 2. If it were possible, I should prefer to show, rather than speak, my feelings. Even if I were arguing a point, I should not stamp my foot, or toss my arms about, or raise my voice; but I should leave that sort of thing to the orator, and should be content to have conveyed my feelings to you without having either embellished them or lowered their dignity. 3. I should like to convince you entirely of this one fact, – that I feel whatever I say, that I not only feel it, but am wedded to it. It is one sort of kiss which a man gives his mistress, and another which he gives his children; yet in the father's embrace also, holy and restrained as it is, plenty of affection is disclosed.
> 
> I prefer, however, that our conversation on matters so important should not be meagre and dry; for even philosophy does not renounce the company of cleverness. One should not, however, bestow very much attention upon mere words. 4. Let this be the kernel of my idea: let us say what we feel, and feel what we say; let speech harmonize with life.[3] That man has fulfilled his promise who is the same person both when you see him and when you hear him. 5. We shall not fail to see what sort of man he is and how large a man he is, if only he is one and the same. Our words should aim not to please, but to help. If, however, you can attain eloquence without painstaking, and if you either are naturally gifted or can gain eloquence at slight cost, make the most of it and apply it to the noblest uses. But let it be of such a kind that it displays facts rather than itself. It and the other arts are wholly concerned with cleverness;[4] but our business here is the soul.
> 
> A sick man does not call in a physician who is eloquent; but if it so happens that the physician who can cure him likewise discourses elegantly about the treatment which is to be followed, the patient will take it in good part. For all that, he will not find any reason to congratulate himself on having discovered a physician who is eloquent. For the case is no different from that of a skilled pilot who is also handsome. 7. Why do you tickle my ears? Why do you entertain me? There is other business at hand; I am to be cauterized, operated upon, or put on a diet. That is why you were summoned to treat me!
> 
> You are required to cure a disease that is chronic and serious, – one which affects the general weal. You have as serious a business on hand as a physician has during a plague. Are you concerned about words? Rejoice this instant if you can cope with things. When shall you learn all that there is to learn? When shall you so plant in your mind that which you have learned, that it cannot escape? When shall you put it all into practice? For it is not sufficient merely to commit these things to memory, like other matters; they must be practically tested. He is not happy who only knows them, but he who does them. 8. You reply: "What? Are there no degrees of happiness below your 'happy' man? Is there a sheer descent immediately below wisdom?" I think not. For though he who makes progress is still numbered with the fools, yet he is separated from them by a long interval. Among the very persons who are making progress there are also great spaces intervening. They fall into three classes,[5] as certain philosophers believe. 9. First come those who have not yet attained wisdom but have already gained a place near by. Yet even that which is not far away is still outside. These, if you ask me, are men who have already laid aside all passions and vices, who have learned what things are to be embraced; but their assurance is not yet tested. They have not yet put their good into practice, yet from now on they cannot slip back into the faults which they have escaped. They have already arrived at a point from which there is no slipping back, but they are not yet aware of the fact; as I remember writing in another letter, "They are ignorant of their knowledge."[6] It has now been vouchsafed to them to enjoy their good, but not yet to be sure of it. 10. Some define this class, of which I have been speaking, – a class of men who are making progress, – as having escaped the diseases of the mind, but not yet the passions, and as still standing upon slippery ground; because no one is beyond the dangers of evil except him who has cleared himself of it wholly. But no one has so cleared himself except the man who has adopted wisdom in its stead.
> 
> I have often before explained the difference between the diseases of the mind and its passions. And I shall remind you once more: the diseases are hardened and chronic vices, such as greed and ambition; they have enfolded the mind in too close a grip, and have begun to be permanent evils thereof. To give a brief definition: by "disease" we mean a persistent perversion of the judgment, so that things which are mildly desirable are thought to be highly desirable. Or, if you prefer, we may define it thus: to be too zealous in striving for things which are only mildly desirable or not desirable at all, or to value highly things which ought to be valued but slightly or valued not at all. 12. "Passions" are objectionable impulses of the spirit, sudden and vehement; they have come so often, and so little attention has been paid to them, that they have caused a state of disease; just as a catarrh,[7] when there has been but a single attack and the catarrh has not yet become habitual, produces a cough, but causes consumption when it has become regular and chronic. Therefore we may say that those who have made most progress are beyond the reach of the "diseases"; but they still feel the "passions" even when very near perfection.
> 
> The second class is composed of those who have laid aside both the greatest ills of the mind and its passions, but yet are not in assured possession of immunity.[8] For they can still slip back into their former state. 14. The third class are beyond the reach of many of the vices and particularly of the great vices, but not beyond the reach of all. They have escaped avarice, for example, but still feel anger; they no longer are troubled by lust, but are still troubled by ambition; they no longer have desire, but they still have fear. And just because they fear, although they are strong enough to withstand certain things, there are certain things to which they yield; they scorn death, but are in terror of pain.
> 
> Let us reflect a moment on this topic. It will be well with us if we are admitted to this class. The second stage is gained by great good fortune with regard to our natural gifts and by great and unceasing application to study. But not even the third type is to be despised. Think of the host of evils which you see about you; behold how there is no crime that is not exemplified, how far wickedness advances every day, and how prevalent are sins in home and commonwealth. You will see, therefore, that we are making a considerable gain, if we are not numbered among the basest.
> 
> "But as for me," you say, "I hope that it is in me to rise to a higher rank than that!" I should pray, rather than promise, that we may attain this; we have been forestalled. We hasten towards virtue while hampered by vices. I am ashamed to say it; but we worship that which is honourable only in so far as we have time to spare.[9] But what a rich reward awaits us if only we break off the affairs which forestall us and the evils that cling to us with utter tenacity! 17. Then neither desire nor fear shall rout us. Undisturbed by fears, unspoiled by pleasures, we shall be afraid neither of death nor of the gods; we shall know that death is no evil and that the gods are not powers of evil. That which harms has no greater power than that which receives harm, and things which are utterly good have no power at all to harm.[10] 18. There await us, if ever we escape from these low dregs to that sublime and lofty height, peace of mind and, when all error has been driven out, perfect liberty. You ask what this freedom is? It means not fearing either men or gods; it means not craving wickedness or excess; it means possessing supreme power over oneself And it is a priceless good to be master of oneself. Farewell.

#5863670222

| You shouldn't chase after the past
| or place expectations on the future.
| What is past
| 	is left behind.
| The future
| 	is as yet unreached.
| Whatever quality is present
| you clearly see right there,
| 	   right there.
| Not taken in,
| unshaken,
| that's how you develop the heart.
| Ardently doing
| what should be done     today,
| for — who knows? —  tomorrow
| 	death.
| There is no bargaining
| with Mortality & his mighty horde.
| 
| Whoever lives thus ardently,
| 	relentlessly
| 	both day & night,
| has truly had an auspicious day:
| so says the Peaceful Sage.

It's really just a concise paragraph conveying some wisdom, with dramatic pauses conveyed by indenting and splitting up long lines. I could do this. Just write something brilliant, and after that add dramatic pauses by indenting and splitting up long lines.

## Start of an Editorial Checklist {#id5860380222}

#5860380222

[_] Have I been utterly truthful?
[_] Have I said all that I need to say?
[_] Have I been appropriately diplomatic and fair?
[_] Do I have three parts to the piece—an opener, a middle, and a closer?
[_] In my opener, have I made my points quickly and clearly? And concretely?
[_] Have I avoided a slow wind-up that unnecessarily postpones the message? 
[_] In the middle, have I proved my points with specifics?
[_] Is the structure immediately apparent to my readers?
[_] Have I used informative headings?
[_] Is my closer consistent with the rest—yet expressed freshly?
[_] Have I avoided lame repetition?

## My Life Commitments {#id5871700222}

#5871700222

It seems like I only have these commitments right now:

1. Supporting my family, financially.
2. Getting Joey set up as an independent adult.
3. Getting Tommy set up as an independent adult.
4. Saving enough to retire.
5. Maintaining my marriage.

I go to work because of Commitments 1 and 4. Any time I spend parenting the boys is for Commitments 2 and 3. These seem to group themselves together a little. 

1. Providing.
1. Parenting.
1. Adulting.

I provide food, shelter, medicine, dental care, and clothing to my wife, my kids, my dog, and myself. I provide parental care and advice to the kids. I plan for their educational expenses. I try to make sure they each feel valued and supported. I try to do special things with them: with Tommy they are mostly guitar-related, and with Joey it's a grab bag of things. Driving is one. We previously gave running and working out with weights a try. And last, but by no means least is being a grown-up with Julie as my partner. This is a good commitment to have. I call it adulting.

## Letters to Joey {#id5861940222}

#5861940222

Julie had a good suggestion. I could start writing emails to Joey. I mean philosophical emails, emails that impart wisdom. They would be more like epistles or letters than emails. Picture, if you will, my own imperfect imitation of the epistles of Seneca the Younger and Thomas Jefferson. It's to learn to write as well as they do that motivates me to consider this project.

I have been recently reading books and articles about writing, especially ones written by Brian Garner. He is a lawyer who writes books about writing, written for lawyers. That's not why I am interested in him. I just love the quality of his writing style. It's a great writer who wants to write to me to help me become a great writer: win-win.

Bryan endorses a system of writing where you first brainstorm, then outline, then draft quickly, and finally revise and edit.[^macj] He calls it the Madman, the Architect, the Carpenter, and the Judge, names he adopted from an English professor named Betty S. Flowers.

[^macj]: I used some of this technique for this section of my journal. The parts I used were the Carpenter and Judge parts. First, I wrote the section very quickly, using dictation. Second, I re-read it and made edits along the way. And third, I read it out loud and made some final edits. I wanted it to sound natural when read aloud.

My aspiration, for the first letter at least, is to brainstorm each Tuesday night, outline Wednesday night, revise and edit Thursday night, and then do a final revision and send it on Friday night. That is a comfortable pace that will not be too much of a burden: I expect only 15-20 minutes per night. 

I like the idea. Tonight I entered some ideas into a mind map, coming up with an assortment of topics in orbit about the concept of the letter-writing idea itself. Tomorrow I will attempt to outline.

## Word Count Analysis {#id5869660222}

#5869660222

Note, this section contains 328 words organized into sentences approximately 13 words in length; Bryan Garner recommends an average of 20 words per sentence. <https://countwordsworth.com/sentences>

## Letter Writing {#id5882440222}

#5882440222

These are some notes from inspecting the book, _How to Write First-Class Letters, the handbook for practical letter writing_ by L. Sue Baugh. I have it as an `.epub` file.

- Letter writing is a form of dialogue.
- Make your leters _recipient_-based rather than _writer_-based.
- Letter writing is a simple three-step process:
    1. Prewriting, which means asking these four questions, and then gathering pertinent information on the subject:
        1. What is my purpose?
        1. Who is my audience?
        1. What should the letter cover?
        1. What action or response do I want?
    1. Writing, which means writing the entire thing all the way through to the end. Just write until you have a complete letter.
    1. Revising.
- Revising includes a lot of things:
    - Challenging vague words.
    - Deleting unnecessary points.
    - Deleting unnecessary words.
    - Deleting fancy words.
    - Deleting irrelevant premises.
    - Double-checking facts, figures, and references.
    - Proofreading for grammar

I'm not sure I prefer this over the Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge model. I think I will marry the two. The part I like about this one are the four questions whenever you write a letter.

1. What is my purpose?
1. Who is my audience?
1. What should the letter cover?
1. What action or response do I want?

## Is Loyalty a Schema? {#id3568340222}

#3568340222

#schema

I was thinking a little bit about what schemas are, and it occurred to me suddenly that loyalty must be a schema, because it is a series of social interactions.

## Killer Checklist Idea {#id5867340222}

I came up with this killer checklist format today.

![Checklist Format](images/checklist-page_2021-09-25.png)

This could be thought of as a "needs to be" checklist. An item like this: _1. Affected Drawing List..........Created_ could be read as "and Affected Drawing List _needs to be_ created."

## Relations and Relationships {#id5867710222}

#5867710222

I was trying to figure out if object-oriented programming used the word _relation_ or _relationship_, so I did two Google searches to find out.

| `"oop" "relationships" -relations` gave 961,000 results.
| `"oop" "relations" -relationships` gave 2,120,000 results.

It appears, then, that **relations 

is the winner.

## Merritt {#id5892790222}

#5892790222

I have an idea for an app that lets you track things that you consider earning merit. I named it ironically after my grandfather, Merritt Davis. This gives it a distinctive name that will be easier to Google.

The minimum viable product would feature:

1. One list of activities.
1. The ability to check or uncheck items on the activities list.
1. A reset script that runs every day.
1. A reminder screen to check off items from the day before.
1. The date prominently featured at the top of the page.

## Risks in Society {#id5871770222}

#5871770222

When dealing with risks in projects, I wonder if we should always speak of "risk of X". Rather than just "risk". Mr. makes sense grammatically to me. Ask what the risks are, someone's response would be, there is a risk of A, a risk of B, and a risk of C.

![Risks in Society](images/risks-in-society.png)

For one event with potential consequences, risk, $R$, is equal to the probability that the event will occur, $P$, multiplied by the consequences given the event occurs, $C$.

$$R = P \times C$$

The formula is only provided as a foundation for the following formula, which would be for an activity with $n$ events that could cause consequences.

$$R = \sum_{i=1}^n P_i \times C_i$$

From this model, we can see:

- An activity, $A$, is associated with $n$ potential outcomes, $i$.
- Each potential outcome, $i$, has an expected consequence, $C_i$.
- Each potential outcome, $i$, has an anticipated probability, $P_i$.
- The risk of outcome, $i$ is given by: $R_i = P_i \times C_i$.

Let's try re-writing the formula, then.

$$x \in A, R(A) = \sum P(x|A) C(x)$$

| $A$ is an activity.
| $x$ is an outcome.
| $P(x|A)$ is the probability of outcome $x$ given activity $A$.
| $C(x)$ is the consequence of outcome $x$.
| $R(A)$ is the total risk associated with activity $A$.

What does _activity_ mean then? Take activity here to mean any activity from the smallest thing like walking across a room to larger things like projects. A project, then, under this model would be an activity, ontologically.

Now, let's go back and look at the table [Risks in Society]. The first column, "Approximate death rate", appears to be what Kahneman and Tversky would call "base rates." 

The second column, "Typical exposure" is interesting. Recently learned that exposure is usually interchangeable with probability. But if we follow this table, exposure is not equivalent to probability. Probability would be exposure times base rate. 

Third column, "Typical risk of death," is strange, too. I think it should be probability, not risk. The only thing that makes it risk is that the consequence is included: death.

Another insight from this table is that construction work is wildly riskier than structural failures. I should keep this in mind when making decisions.

"Risk of death" should be expanded to "risk of death for an activity is the base rate times in events per hour times the exposure in hours." Here _death_ is a consequence. The total risk for the activity would be the sum of the risk of each consequence given the activity, base rate, and exposure.

![Risk-Based Decision Analysis Process](images/risk-based-decision-analysis.png)

![Risk-Based Decision Analysis Process](images/risk-based-decision-analysis-annotated.png)

Item #3 techniques:

- Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)
- Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
- Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)
- Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP)
- Risk Screening (Hazid Sessions)

For analysis of consequences (#4) consider using pairwise comparisons made by experts.

Base evaluation of probabilities (#5) on failure rates for electrical or mechanical systems and structural reliability for structures. Consider Monte Carlo analysis.

What if scenarios are used to analyze sensitivities (#7).

In risk treatment (#9) we compare calculated risks to acceptable risks stated in the risk acceptance criteria. Then unacceptable risks are handled by one of the following means:

1. Risk mitigation. Modify the system to remove the risk.
1. Risk reduction. Act to reduce the probability or consequences.
1. Risk transfer. Buy insurance, for example.
1. Risk acceptance. Adjust the risk acceptance criteria to accept the risk.

We then monitor and review (#10). This feedback loop improves the process.

## A Positive Affirmation {#id5899480222}

#5899480222

Add this positive affirmation to my Anki deck:

> "I am at peace with all that has happened, is happening, and will happen."

I think what it means is three things. You might as well be at peace with what has happened, because it cannot be changed now. It will be at peace with what is happening, because the causes of it are so complicated that you can't possibly control them. And likewise for what will happen. The chain of events from this moment forward is also not under your control.

## Do Myself or Delegate? {#id3579470222}

#3579470222

![TECO Salary Analysis 2021](images/teco-salary-analysis-2021.png)

 taking into account all the hours I spend earning money at TECO, including commuting and free overtime, I make about $50 per hour in take-home pay. Some of that goes directly to 401(k) and savings. 

 When considering whether I should attempt to do something myself, I should use this formula:

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{P(S|M)} \geq \dfrac{\times C}{P(S|D)}$$

| Where:
| $S$ = Success.
| $P()$ = Probability.
| $M$ = Do it myself.
| $D$ = Delegate it.
| $C$ = Cost paid to delegate it.
| $P(S|M)$ = Subjective probability of success if I do it myself.
| $P(S|D)$ = Subjective probability of success if I delegate it myself.
| $H$ = Hours I estimate it will take me to do it myself.

Let's do a trial run here and look at Joey's neon light. I have tried over and over to fix it, unsuccessfully. That money is gone - a sunk cost - so I will ignore it. 

I estimate my probability of success to be 50%. I am totally unsure if I can fix it. I estimate hours at 4. So the left-hand side becomes:

$$\dfrac{4 \times 50}{0.50} = 400$$

I estimate the probability of success of a delegated solution to be 99%. I estimate the cost as $500. So the right-hand side becomes:

$$\dfrac{500}{0.99} = 505$$

According to my formula, then, I should try to do it myself. It is close.

To be indifferent to the decision, we set the two sides equal. Then we can solve for $H$ that would make it worthwhile.

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{0.50} = \dfrac{500}{0.99}$$

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{0.50} = 505$$

$$H = \dfrac{0.50 \times 505}{50} = 5.05\text{ say } \underline{5\text{ hours}}$$

## Joe as a System {#id5885750222}

#5885750222

## Our Family as a System {#id5872460222}

#5872460222

### Components

{ Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, possessions }

Possessions include all the things we legally control.

### External Systems

The external systems are infinite in number. We probably want to settle on a few of greater interest.

{ extended family, employer, consumer economy, legal system, government, social group }

### Resources

We have both tangible and intangible resources. Our possessions are tangible resources. The goodwill we have with other systems is an intangible resource we can tap into.

### System Benefactors

Benefactors include anybody who benefits from the family system. The family members are the obvious primary three.

{ Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Elaine, Bob, Terry, Ron, family, social group (all levels), society (all levels) }

The Users of the system are only the five of us dependent living things: { Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Maggie }

### System Life Cycle

| **Stage 1:** Joe and Julie
| **Stage 2:** Joe, Julie, and Joey
| **Stage 3:** Joe, Julie, Joey, and Tommy
| **Stage 4:** Julie, Joey, and Tommy
| **Stage 5:** Joey and Tommy
| **Stage 6:** Tommy

We are in Stage 3 right now. The next stage transition will be when Joe dies, moving to Stage 4. After Julie dies at a ripe, old age, Joey and Tommy will continue into Stage 5. Joey is older and so will die sooner, moving into Stage 6 until Tommy dies of old age. This is the system life cycle of the family of Joe and Julie.

### System Operating Domain

The family's sphere of influence extends at least as far as Europe. I don't know what more to say about this. It seems more applicable to systems like aircraft.

### System Frame of Reference

Our _physical_ frame of reference:

| The physical location of each system element (person or possession)
| 819 Walsingham Way, Valrico, Florida, United States of America
| North America
| Western Hemisphere
| Northern Hemisphere
| Planet Earth
| Earth's Solar System
| Milky Way Galaxy
| The Milky Way's Galactic Cluster
| The Milky Way Galactic Cluster's Super Cluster

There is one _temporal_ frame of reference:

- Current period in history

There is one _moral_ frame of reference:

- Current moral Zeitgeist

There is one _ethical_ frame of reference:

- Societal norms

Our _familial_ frame of reference includes:

- McCoy extended family
- Legner extended family

Our _social_ frame of reference includes:

- Friends of any family member
- Our neighborhood
- Our community
- Our county
- Our state
- Our country
- Western democratic society
- Western society
- Human society

### Higher Order Systems

Higher order systems govern, direct, constrain, and control the operation and performance of the Legner Family system. These systems provide resources for missions.

- Universal society (imagined)
- Intergalactic society (imagined)
- Interplanetary society (imagined)
- Human society
- Civilized human society
- International society
- Federal society
- State society
- County society
- Local society
- HOA
- Employers

### Purpose-Based Role

The purpose of the family is to benefit its benefactors. The vision is for all its benefactors to be thriving.

### System Missions

The family system performs missions in fulfillment of its purpose to achieve outcome-based performance objectives established by its owners and users.

- Provide what is needed for each family member to flourish
- Add value to higher order systems

### Mission Goals and Performance Objectives

Given the two missions above, what are the mission goals? Each goal must be supported by one or more specific objectives that are quantifiable, measurable, testable, and verifiable. This is something we need to work on.

- Goal #1: Safety
- Goal #2: Life-Long Learning
- Goal #3: Financial Stability
- Goal #4: Kids Independent
- Goal #5: Retirement

**Goal #1:** Safety

- Objective #1-1: Zero accidental injuries
- Objective #1-2: Zero violent crimes
- Objective #1-3: Acceptable self-reported mental health

**Goal #2:** Life-Long Learning

- Objective #2-1:  
- Objective #2-2: 
- Objective #2-3: 

**Goal #3:** Financial Stability

- Objective #3-1: 
- Objective #3-2: 
- Objective #3-3: 

**Goal #4:** Kids Independent

- Objective #4-1: 
- Objective #4-2: 
- Objective #4-3: 

**Goal #5:** Retirement

- Objective #5-1: 
- Objective #5-2: 
- Objective #5-3: 

### System Operating Constraints and Conditions

- Volitional acts are constrained by societal rules. This happens at many levels of description.
- The physical world is constrained by physical laws. This also happens at many levels of description.
- The system's capabilities are constrained by the family members' competencies.

### System Utility

The system provides physical, psychological, sociological, financial, and economic _value-added utility_ to its Users, namely the four family members.

- Physical
    - Protection
    - Health care
    - Dental care
- Psychological
    - Love
    - Caring
    - Kindness
- Sociological
    - Teaching
    - Belonging
- Financial
    - Savings
    - College savings
    - Retirement savings
- Economic
    - Income
    - Insurance
    - Legal services

### System Suitability

The family system is suited to providing support to its Users.

### System Success Criteria

Success means User acceptance and level of satisfaction. A User means one of { Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Maggie }.

### Mission Reliability

This is the probability of success in accomplishing mission objectives for a specified mission duration and set of operating environment conditions and scenarios.

### System Effectiveness

Each stakeholder has its own opinion of the effectiveness of a system. 

### System Efficiency

The family system is not very efficient.

### System Integrity

I'm not sure what _level of integrity_ means.

### System Sustainment

This includes the inputs needed to sustain the family system. Such inputs are obtained from outside the family system. For example, money, food, and all manner of manufactured products are all used to sustain the family system.

### System Promotion

The family system does not really promote itself. I would say this is not applicable.

### System Threats

Threats to the family are numerous.

1. Accident
1. Violence
1. Animals
1. Insects
1. Viruses
1. Bacteria
1. Financial problems
1. Betrayal

### System Concealment

The system does not conceal itself.

### System Protection

Protective measures include:

1. Locks and keys
1. Smoke alarms
1. Fire extinguishers
1. Insurance policies
1. Weapons
1. Passwords

### System Security

The family system is most concerned with physical security: PHYSEC.

### System Architecture

The system is a traditional human family consisting of two married parents, male and female, and two offspring, both male. It also includes a dog.

### System Capabilities

1. Provide money
1. Provide goods and services
1. Provide for physical needs of family members
1. Provide for emotional needs of family members
1. Provide education
1. Connects individuals
1. Defends against threats
1. Provides opportunities for growth

### System Concept of Operations

The two parents call the shots, but with significant input from the two kids. The dog does not have much say.

### System Phases, Modes, and States of Operation

1. Problem mode
1. Adventure mode
1. Normal mode

### Operating Norms, Standards, and Conventions

Family members:

1. Treat each other with respect and honesty
1. Speak and behave with integrity
1. Act with kindness
1. Help each other

### System Description

The system consists of a traditional human family with four human members and a canine.

1. Joe Legner, age 48, male, engineer.
1. Julie Legner, age 46, female, musician.
1. Joey Legner, age 18, male, student.
1. Tommy Legner, age 16, male, student.
1. Maggie, age 12, female, dog.

Joe and Julie are married.

The dog is adopted.

### System Sensors

1. Communications devices
1. Cameras
1. Recording devices

### System Behavior Patterns

1. School and work pattern.
1. School break and work pattern.
1. Vacation pattern.
1. Holiday pattern.

### System Responsiveness and Sensitivity

I don't know what to say here.

### System Interfaces

1. Meeting face-to-face
1. Email
1. Phones
1. Mail

### System Pedigree

The system pedigree is an unbroken chain of human families, most recently the immediate family of Joe's parents and the immediate family of Julie's parents. The system evolved from these two ancestors with a lot of wisdom and experience drawn from the world beyond the two ancestral family units.

## Rust Program Test {#id5891510222}

#5891510222

Refer to [2020-10-17 Nim Language Experiment]. I replicated this program in Rust as follows.

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut heads_rolled: bool;
    let mut heads_count: usize = 0;
    let mut tails_count: usize = 0;
    let mut n = 0: usize;

    loop {
        heads_rolled = random();
        if heads_rolled {
            heads_count += 1;
        } else {
            tails_count += 1;
        }
        if heads_count + tails
    }
    println!("{} heads and {} tails", heads_count, tails_count);
}
```

The results were:
```bash
$ time ./target/release/coin_toss_rust
500651 heads and 499348 tails
./target/release/coin_toss_rust  0.01s user 0.00s system 87% cpu 0.016 total
```

| Language |  Time | Ratio to Python | Ratio to NIM | Ratio to Rust |
|----------|------:|:---------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| Python   | 1.150 |       1         |     16    |      72   |
| Nim      | 0.074 |        -        |      1    |      4.6     |
| Rust     | 0.016 |        -        |       -      |      1     |

Rust is easily the fastest. It makes Python look stupid. It is even about 5 times faster than Nim which is already much faster than Python.

## Entity and Component Architecture {#id5882880222}

#5882880222

1. An Entity is nothing but a unique identifier, usually an integer.
1. A component is a piece of data. It should be kept very atomic, but it can have more than one field.
1. An aspect is a set of components.

## Improvement Methodologies {#id5879580222}

#5879580222

<http://jamme.acmsse.h2.pl/papers_vol43_1/43155.pdf>

The **PDCA cycle 

is a well known fundamental concept of continuous- improvement processes.

**RADAR matrix 

provides a structured approach assessing the organizational performance.

**DMAIC 

is a systematic, and fact based approach providing framework of results-oriented project management.

**DFSS 

is a systematic approach to new products or processes design focusing on prevent activities.

## Entity Component System Architecture {#id5865520222}

#5865520222

```python
import random

class Entity:

    def __init__(self):
        self.key = random.randint(1, 0000000010)

class Component1:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data1A = ...
        self.data1B = ...
        self.data1C = ...

class Component2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data2A = ...
        self.data2B = ...
        self.data2C = ...

class Component3:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data3A = ...
        self.data3B = ...
        self.data3C = ...

def create_entity_type1():
    return Entity(Component1(), Component2(), Component3())
```

Let's try something a little more interesting.

```python
import random

class Entity:
    def __init__(self, *args):
        self.key = random.randint(1, 0000000010)
        self.components = list(args)    # not sure this works, but you get the idea

class Position:
    def __init__(self, lat, lon, draft):
        self.lat = lat
        self.lon = lon
        self.draft = draft

class Bearing:
    def __init__(self, angle):
        self.angle = angle

class ForwardVelocity:
    def __init__(self, knots):
        self.knots = knots

def create_vessel(lat, lon, draft, bearing, velocity):
    "A vessel is an entity with position, bearing, and forward velocity."
    return Entity(Position(lat, lon, draft), Bearing(bearing), ForwardVelocity(velocity))

def has_component(entity, component):
    "Return true if entity has component"
    return component in [type(c) for c in e.components]

def has_components(entity, components):
    "Return true if entity has these components"
    retval = True
    for component in components:
        retval = retval and has_component(entity, component)
    return retval

def physics_system(entity):
    if has_components(entity, (Position, ForwardVelocity, Bearing)):
        pass
        # Now how do I get the data when I need it??


if __name__ == "__main__":
    entity_context = set()
    entity_context.add(create_vessel(lat=83.442, lon=66.4321, draft=8.5, bearing=53.5, velocity=4.5))

    # TODO: create an over-arching loop
    for e in entity_context:
        print(f"Entity {e.key}")
        physics_system(e)

```


Come to think of it, you don't need to generate random keys. Why not just start with zero? You will have to maintain a list of numbers so you can delete them in the middle when things get removed in the model. Each new entity just gets the next available integer. It's probably best not to re-use deleted ones, in case there is some kind of undo feature later. We will also have to keep track of the last number we generated. 

On second thought, it would be better to keep it a simple list of integers. It could even be a list of booleans, because all you need is the position in the list and a boolean telling you if it is valid (True) or deleted (False).

Rather than delete from the entity context, I would probably just set the value to None. 

### World Class

The entities, components, and systems (processors) should all belong to a world. Or maybe it should be called a "model". Anyway, something needs to own everything, including the system instances.

```python
entities = []
components = []
processors = []


class Beam:
    def __init__(self, w, L):
        self.L = L
        self.w = w


def create_entity():
    entities.append(len(entities))
    return len(entities)-1

def create_component(e, c):
    c.entity = e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_component(Beam(L=24.5, w=0.94))
    

```

## Joe's Productivity Theory {#id2670720222}

#2670720222

$$P \geq D$$

$$P = R \times T$$

$$R \times T \geq D$$

$$R \geq \frac{D}{T}$$

$$T \geq \frac{D}{R}$$

$$R = E \times L \times (1 - W) \times U$$

$T$ = Time

$P$ = Productivity in units

$R$ = Productivity rate in units per unit time

$D$ = Demand in units

$E$ = Effort: 0=no effort, 1=greatest possible human effort that can be sustained indefinitely.

$L$ = Leverage: a number greater than 1, where 1 represents no leverage, only the amount of effort of a single, unaided person. Thus, a leverage of $L=2$ means twice the amount of effort of an unaided person.

$W$ = Waste: 0=no moment is lost, 1=no moment is productive.

$U$ = Utilization rate: 0=no time is productive, everything is training, staff meetings, or vacations to 1=all time is productive; there is no training, staff meetings, or vacations.

## Overtime {#id5875370222}

#5875370222

A year has 2,080 hours. From this number we must subtract eight hours for each holiday and vacation day. Subtract 9 holidays and 20 vacation days. This amounts to subtracting 232 hours for a net of 1,848 hours. We also need to subtract training and community service days. Let's subtract 6 days or 48 hours for those. We are now down to 1,800 hours, a nice round number! By this estimate, in one calendar year we are at work 225 days.

Now we have to get more granular. 

There are many things that do not amount to a full day. The obvious ones is meetings of a kind that are outside of production. Most meetings are non-productive in this sense: you are not working on the work products promised by a project. You are working on a schedule or something outside projects. Let's assume, on average, that 2 hours per day is spent in meetings like this. Anyone working where I work would laugh at how low that estimate is. But assuming it is 2 hours, we are going to have to subtract $225 \times 2 = 450$ hours from productive working time.

How much do we have now? 1,800 - 450 = 1,350 hours available to do actual productive work. I am not saying we are productive during this work time by any means. We walk around, get a drink, use the restroom, check our social media, clip our fingernails, brush our teeth, and do a hundred other things. But let's say we are in busy mode. We do these little things, but we are pretty well occupied most of the time outside meetings. We can call it the "busy, not rushed" level of effort. 

So, we start with 1,350 hours of busy, not rushed level of effort. Now let's talk about overtime.

Let's make everyone really busy, add two hours per day. This adds 450 hours of additional productive work.

Another thing to consider about the overtime: is it just as productive? It can't be. People get burned out and low, for one thing. People get worn out, during the day even. 

Ignoring wear-out, we have increased our productivity from 1,350 to 1,800 hours. Not bad. This is an increase of 1/3. So, if an engineer could design 24 projects in a year without overtime, she could design 32 projects in a year with overtime.

But let's account for the weight of the overtime on productivity. This is a lot of overtime to sustain for an entire year. I think as time went on, people are probably going to check out, and we won't end up with even an hour per day of added productivity. In other words, even if you make them stay, you are not going to get more than 1 extra hour out of folks after indefinite lengths of time continuously working that hard. I am assuming all along that they are not paid for overtime. 

Now we only get 225 more hours of productive work in a year. We have only increased our productivity from 1,350 to 1,575 hours. This is an increase of 1/6. 

But what does this do for morale? Do we get more absenteeism? Do we get more turnover? Probably. 

We would do 24 projects at a nice leisurely pace. With a ton of overtime, we will do 28 projects. Is it worth it? Why not have happier employees working at a nice flow and get 24 projects done, and retain everyone for as long as we want them.

![Inverted Organization](images/inverted.png)

## Anki Cards {#id5890420222}

#5890420222

I think my Anki cloze cards are excessive. Some go up to `c7` and maybe even `c8`. I wonder if I should make them more atomic. What would an atomic card be like? Here are some competing ideas.

- Each card conveys one bit of information.
- Each card conveys one binary relation.

Let's examine an example.

```
{{c5::Bhāvanā::Pali word}} literally means {{c1::developing}}, {{c2::cultivating}}, or {{c3::producing}} in the sense of "calling into {{c4::existence}}".
```

This card is about the Pali word Bhavana. It has five (5) cloze deletions. Should it? Is it really worth my time to memorize it verbatim? I don't think that adds value. The value is the Bhavana part. That's the new information I'm trying to learn. Let's re-formulate it more atomically:

```
{{c1::Bhāvanā::Pali word}} literally means developing, cultivating, or producing in the sense of "calling into existence".
```

This will save me umpteen reviews moving forward.

Here is another one:

```
Consider your {{c1::purpose}} and your {{c2::audience::a...}} before you begin writing, and let these guide both {{c3::what}} you say and {{c4::how you say it}}.
```

What's the point of this? Your purpose and audience should inform and constrain the writing process. Let's re-write it as its essence:

```
Your {{c1::purpose}} and {{c2::audience}} should inform and constrain the writing process.
```

## My Types of Close Notes {#id5863510222}

#5863510222

### Contrast Note

Some notes contrast two items. Here is an example contrasting the word "drastic" from the word "dramatic":

```
{{c1::Dramatic}} denotes attention-getting or extreme results, while {{c2::drastic}} refers to rapid, violent, or severe actions.
```

Could this be improved upon? Maybe it could become two atomic cards, for example:

```
{{c1::Dramatic::Dramatic | Drastic}} denotes attention-getting or extreme results.
```

```
{{c1::Drastic::Dramatic | Drastic}} refers to rapid, violent, or severe actions.
```

I did not make this change. 

### Formula Note

Some give math, engineering, or financial formulas or equations.

### Image Occlusion Note

Some cards have a diagram, figure, photo, or map with features masked.

### List Note

Some cards have a list to memorize.

### Procedure Note

A procedure note gives a sequence of steps to accomplish an objective. For it to add value, it seems like all these should be true:

- Q1: Is it correct? Does it work?
- Q2: Does it come up often enough to be worth worrying about?

Here is an example from my current deck.

```
What are the five steps for hypothesis testing?
Step 1 - State the {{c1::null}} and {{c1::alternative}} hypotheses
Step 2 - Set the {{c2::threshold}} of the test
Step 3 - Assume the {{c4::null}} hypothesis is {{c3::true}}.
Step 4 - Calculate the {{c5::p-value}}.
Step 5 - State your {{c6::conclusion}}.
```

For this one, Q1 is true and Q2 is false. I should simplify or eliminate it.

### Quote Note

Some cards have sayings, aphorisms, or quotes that I believe are worth learning verbatim. 

### Social Note

Some of my notes are for memorizing facts about people I interact with: the name of their spouse, their favorite thing, hobby, etc. These are intended to strengthen my social intelligence.

### Trivia Note

Some notes just give little facts I think it's fun to know or might make me look smart in front of others. Here is an example.

```
1 pound = {{c1::7000}} grains.
```

Is this useful to me? Not really. It's fun, somehow. Maybe it feeds that childlike want to be seen as smart.

### Vocabulary Note

Some notes just give word definitions. They are similar to the trivia notes.

## Prosocial Behavior and Self-Serving Behavior {#id5864550222}

#5864550222

My newest hypothesis having read this blog entry: <https://quillette.com/2021/11/29/the-universal-structure-of-storytelling/>

> Human psychology involves a tension between two opposing priorities: prosocial behavior and self-serving behavior.

The thesis of the article seems to be this claim:

> Storytelling developed as a way to indoctrinate and condition prosocial behavior in members of the tribe, with the good guys righteously opposing the bad guys.

The "good" part of the good guys describes behaviors that move the state of affairs _toward_ the flourishing of the good guys' group, and the "bad" part of the bad guys describe behaviors that tend to split up the good guys' group.

## Journaling {#id5890450222}

#5890450222

It's probably good to journal, because you are really thinking for yourself. You are not reading. You are creating something new from your own ideas. It seems like synthesizing new ideas from your existing ones is the best thing you could do to learn. You are doing what the gurus say: connecting the new stuff to the old stuff. You can even connect old stuff to old stuff. Either way is truly insight. 

I went for a short walk tonight while I listened to Joseph Goldstein. I also smoked, so there's that. I definitely feel some emotional catharsis from doing it. It might also be that I worked hard enough to allow myself to really relax. I did enough. I can relax. That's not a feeling I have very often. 

I have a hypothesis. Let's put it this way: Usually I feel guilty, like I should be doing more. I wonder if that goes back to the time my mom called me lazy. That stung a lot! Maybe this older being is still sore about it and always trying to prove her wrong.

I think it was right to make the preceding paragraph a hypothesis, by adding that first short sentence. You don't have to over-think things when it's a hypothesis. It's kind of light.

## Personas of Purpose {#id5313060222}

#5313060222

#philosophy #purpose

My three "Personas of Purpose," as I call them, are:

1. The Family Man
2. The Gardener
3. The Peaceful Sage

One time I created in Anki card that I ask myself, what does each persona of purpose supply and what does each demand? I got to thinking about it tonight, finally, which was probably the reason for the Anki card to begin with. I don't think we need to list things like necessities. They should be things demanded and supplied in the wrong themselves. It assumes there is a human body to take care of. Sexual release is not considered a necessity.

- The Family Man demands sexual release.
- The Family Man supplies money.
- The Family Man supplies love.
- The Family Man supplies care.

- The Peaceful Sage demands time.
- The Peaceful Sage demands effort.
- The Peaceful Sage supplies wisdom.
 
- The Gardener supplies advice.
- The Gardener supplies kindness.
- The Gardener supplies help.

"Care" means taking care of others, providing them with food, healthcare, and a roof over their head. These things are provided by money, but money is only a means to the ultimate end of the Family Man: caring for his family.

The Peaceful Sage seems to be about acquiring knowledge and wisdom. This is the Buddha-wannabe persona. The Peaceful Sage also has worldly knowledge, practical knowledge. The Peaceful Sage knows how to get things done and the science behind it. He is always learning, studying, improving. He enjoys new insights. He enjoys learning about himself.

The Gardener plants seeds and waters them. The seeds are selected by the Peaceful Sage. The earth is his circle of family and friends. It is a set of individual people that can talk to each other, so ideas can spread in a network fashion. The Gardener may plant a seed in one person only to see it sprout in another, but not being sure if it was his cultivating that got them there. But maybe it was. Maybe the good idea spread.

## My Sayings {#id5867990222}

#5867990222

I really have some great sayings, I just don't always remember them, and I certainly don't live them all consistently, though I think I'm getting better all the time. 

> "I am at peace with all that has happened, is happening, and will happen."

Wouldn't that be great???

> "Substitute 'could' for 'should'." 

I got this one from someone else, I'm sure, but I saw the wisdom and added it as an Anki Card. 

> "Lock up the Judge and writing in a headlong rush."

I have a habit of editing while I am writing. I can seet that now. I have a strong pull to go back and fix something, when instead I should be "writing in a headlong rush" with The Judged locked away.

> "Meditation develops calm and insight."

This is pretty true, and I wonder why I don't meditate more often. I wonder if it is my mind pursuing since pleasures and so forth that interferes with me being able to meditate or being motivated to. My body is running the show.

> "Leaders develop subordinates."

I want to develop subordinates. I think I have a couple really good engineers, and I think I can help them be better engineers and better men.

> "Kindness, respect, truthfulness, timeliness, and wisdom."

For a while I was using these like a mantra. It's interesting that I don't think about them much. I was kind of surprised when I read the card, thinking, "Why haven't I said these recently?"

> "I forgive everyone who has hurt me and move forward with a cleansed soul."

This one is really Buddhist. What is the point of dwelling on the past, or brooding about the failures of others? Not to mention, the person that hurt me does not exist anymore! They have surely grown up and changed just as much as I have. I tend to have a conceit about myself, thinking that I am superior to others. 

I am probably superior to a lot of people, but not everybody, and besides, I think it's possible to have more wisdom than me. I am following the tracks of those that came before me, and even though they lead me in the right direction, I have to appreciate _why_ it was the right direction by looking for myself. I wish I could have a long, unbroken conversation with some of them. That would be heaven to me. God, if you're really there and listening, I want to be able to just interview the Buddha, Jesus, Thomas Jefferson, Karl Popper, and 19-year-old I descended from.

## Some Random Philosophy {#id5890860222}

#5890860222

Saying, "That could have been bad" is strange. It definitely gives me a negative feeling. It is like a little punishment for a sin.

"That could have been bad" seems to mean, roughly, "What I just did, had things been a little different, could have resulted in a loss of something." We can shorten that to, "What I did increases the potential to lose something I value." It adds to the probability of a loss.

Do behavior that add to the probability of a gain event.
Abstain from behavior that adds to the probability of a loss event.

Behaviors can be thoughtful or thoughtless. The thoughtless is unwholesome. The thoughtful is wholesome.

The brain is the subject, and the mind is the verb. 

The mind is what the brain does. If by mind you mean the conscious mind that is typing this, the mind is only one thing the brain does. It also controls the fingers. It has mechanisms ready to react to danger, idle most of the time. It's running low level operating system stuff. It's processing sensory input which cascades through the brain in all sorts of ways. It could be really, really interesting cascades of brain cell firing when you read this next word. Something that is not inside the brain gets shoved in, and it sets off a chain reaction of brain cell activity.

## Non-Self {#id5872740222}

#5872740222

The self is fictitious. It is a trick of the light. A brain feels like a self, for some reason. It's probably something to do with narratives. It's like the narrative style required a persistent object to represent the real, deep, ever-changing human animal.

## Cute Proof of No Good {#id5887510222}

#5887510222

Let $H$ be a hypothesis, a claim about the world. Let $e$ be evidence found in the world.

$$P(H|e) = \dfrac{P(e|H)P(H)}{P(e)}$$

![Posterior Probability](images/posterior-probability.png)

The probability of a hypothesis $H$, given evidence $e$ is equal to the probability of the evidence, given the hypothesis, multiplied by the probability of the hypothesis, all divided by the probability of the evidence.

Now here comes the cute part. Let $H$ be the claim, "There is an all-knowing, all-powerful, and good god, like the Christian God," and let the evidence $e$ be "There is incredibly horrible suffering all the time, all over the world."  Let's shorten it to "there is evil."

We don't know the prior probability of God, $P(H)$. But this won't matter, because it gets swamped by the other term.

The term $P(e|H)$ is called the _likelihood_. For me, the likelihood of god, given evil, is zero.

Evil definitely exists, so the probability of $e$ is 1. 

Now we can compute the posterior probability of god, $P(H|e)$ is zero. 

$$P(H|e) = \dfrac{0 \times P(H)}{1} = 0$$

Therefore:

| P1: If there is evil, there is no God.
| P2: There is evil.
| C:  Therefore, there is no God. (Modus ponens)

## Throttle of the Heart {#id5870850222}

Positive feelings move the throttle of the heart forward, and negative feelings move the throttle backward. Stillness is in the middle.

I call this a "simile" because feelings are _like_ a throttle.

## No Self, No Problem Reading {#id1815060222}

#1815060222

#buddhism #zen

Language is a map. Categories are a map. And, like any map, the map is not the territory.

Pattern

A regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas.

The elements repeat in a predicable manner

Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure.

Language follows patterns. Our uses the subject verb object pattern: Joe ate fish. Another language might literally be Ate fish Joe but means the same thing as the English subject-verb-object pattern. Again, we have repeating elements whose repetition is governed by rules.

Patterns in time exist. Think of the sunrise-sunset pattern. We could think of it as patterns of events. The sunrise-sunset pattern may be one of the most ancient ones in our psyche. Weather patterns exist, where on a certain date in the year (event), we can likely expect a certain type of weather event. Managing patterns is about predicting the future. Predicting the future is about survival, at its most fundamental.  

Maybe differentiating was the first step toward intelligence. The first organism that could differentiate between light and dark would have gained a competitive advantage, say by optimizing its behavior for the amount of light. It gave it another degree of freedom. Whatever it could do before it could differentiate light and dark, it could still do. Those are its prior degrees of freedom. But after it could differentiate between light and dark, it gained the ability to think. It could now adjust its behavior based on the light present. It might be as simple as not to move when it's light and to move when it's dark. This would be the first nocturnal animal.

Maybe these are the three steps in intelligence:

1. Observe
1. Recognize pattern
1. Categorize
1. Form a claim
1. Act

Spelling relies on our ability to see patterns.

A picture represents patterns in reality. We may see a drawing of Angelina Jolie and recognize the pattern: the shape of her face, her cheekbones, her lips, her eyebrows, and everything else. But that pattern is just in our head. 

I recognize the concept Angelina Jolie when I see the painting. Angelina Jolie recognizes the concept of Angelina Jolie when she sees her own face in the mirror. Neither is more than a concept in the brain for a mere moment. It can be retrieved from memory but only lasts for a moment each time.

Intelligence is how much your pattern recognition hardware beats random luck. Random luck could be represented by a binary yes or no. This happens to be a binary digit or bit in information theory. So the intellect has added information to the system.

## Productivity Numbers {#id5887560222}

#5887560222

| $D$ = Demand (production units)
| $P$ = Productivity (production units)
| $R$ = Productivity rate (production units per unit time)
| $T$ = Time (time units)

$$P \geq D$$
$$P = R \times T D$$
$$R \times T \geq D$$
$$R \geq \dfrac{D}{T}$$
$$T \geq \dfrac{D}{R}$$

Let's decompose a little.

| $E$ = Effort: range $[0, 1]$
| $L$ = Leverage: range $[0, \inf)$
| $W$ = Rate of time-wasting: range $[0, 1]$
| $U$ = Utilization rate: range $[0, 1]$

$$R = E \times L \times (1 - W) \times U$$

## Algebra Review {#id5871840222}

#5871840222

| If:
| $$a = b$$
| then:
| $$ac = bc$$
| and:
| $$\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$$

Definition of square root:
$$\sqrt{a}\sqrt{a} = a$$


Prove:
$$\sqrt{a^2b} = a\sqrt{b}$$

$$\sqrt{a^2b} = \sqrt{a^2}\sqrt{b}$$

By the definition of the square root:
$$\sqrt{a^2} = a$$

Square both sides of this equation:
$$(\sqrt{a^2})^2 = a^2$$

By the definition of square root, we see that squaring a square root term eliminates the root.

$$\sqrt{a}\sqrt{a} = a$$
$$(\sqrt{a})^2 = a$$

By this method we see $(\sqrt{a^2})^2 = a^2$ becomes:
$$a^2 = a^2$$

## Joe's Metaphysical Ontology {#id5413060222}

#5413060222

#ontology #philosophy

Cosmos
: The physical universe as experienced by humans.

Universe
: Everything that is, the physical, mental, uncategorized, and uncategorizable.

World
: Human existence, the affairs of life.
: The human race, mankind, humanity.

Earth
: The planet we humans inhabit.

Planet
: See Earth.

Reality
: The sum total of everything having physical existence.
: That which is not imaginary.

What is the difference between imaginary, abstract, and conceptual? 

"Neither falsification nor verification describe the quantitative process whereby scientific inquiry incrementally improves our view of the world, or the way that our physical brains infer and encode a process, and use that inference to motivate either action or insight."

## Innate Social Emotions {#id5514230122}

#5514230122

The right brain seems to have built-in emotions of _gratitude_ and _compassion_ that make sense from the perspective of an evolved social animal.

Complaining
: The opposite of gratitude.
: Things should not be the way they are.
: Things should not have happened.

It seems as though complaining leads to anxiety and depression. It seems unskillful, unhelpful, and unwholesome.

## Right-Brain Buddha {#id5614230122}

#5614230122

> If you cannot control an emotion (like fear), then it is not part of your true nature.

Don't fight or suppress emotions. Notice and abide.

Maybe the Buddha's insight came from his right brain. He wants to teach us to use our right brain in a likewise manner, but to get us started he needs to use words: the discourses on the dharma, for example. All his words just prime our brains to make the same insight once we put ourselves in a position to make such insights -- meditation practice. 

## Form and Void {#id3111230122}

#3111230122

> A thing becomes something when it contrasts with its background.

The background is the void. The contrasting thing is form. So it might be okay to assert:

> Void is form.

And likewise

> Form is void.

Correlary:

> Without silence, sound is not possible.

The space between parts makes the difference. Letters on a page need space around them to function as a communciation tool and a context of other words around it to communicate meaning. The letters and words are form. The page is void. 

> Letters and words are form. The page is void.

About the right brain's big picture thinking we might say:

> The right brain sees the big picture: form and void together.

Another one is this, which seems to point to the idea of context. 

> A figure is determined by its bakground.

Form and void is understood by the right brain [#4614230122](#id4614230122).

## Right Brain {#id4614230122}

#4614230122

If the right brain comes up with a solution, it does so intuitively, and it sends its recommendation to the left side in the form of a "gut feeling."

![Individual](images/individual-part-difference.png)

## Body and Mind in Competition {#id5714230122}

#5714230122

Maybe the body and mind are competing for supremacy. 

- The body feels. The mind is numb. 
- The mind predicts. The body senses.
- The way the mind feels is to induce the body to feel.
- The mind is embodied.

Stimulus leads to experience:

$$ \text{Stimulus} \rightarrow \text{Experience} $$

Also can be expressed:

$$ S \rightarrow E $$

The body is primary, because it stands between the stimulus and the experience of the stimulus in the mind.

$$ \text{Stimulus} \rightarrow \text{Body} \rightarrow \text{Experience} $$

$$ S \rightarrow B \rightarrow E $$

## Permutations Experiment {#id4017240122}

#4017240122

I added an Anki card for permutations a few days ago, and it said the members of our family (4 humans + 1 dog) taken in groups of 3 would yield 60 permutations. I tested this using this Python code:

```python
from itertools import permutations

i = 0
for p in list(permutations(("Joe", "Julie", "Joey", "Tommy", "Maggie",),3)):
    print(f"{i+1}. {p}")
    i=i+1

print(f"{i} total permutations")
```

Here are the results, confirming my hypothesis.

## Completeness {#id1018280122}

#1018280122

#math #logic

> In mathematical logic, a theory is complete if, for every closed formula in the theory's language, that formula or its negation is demonstrable. 

closed formula
: A closed formula has no free occurrences of any variable.
: A formula having only bound variables.

free variable
: A free variable is a notation (symbol) that specifies places in an expression where substitution may take place and is not a parameter of this or any container expression. 
: Some older books use the terms real variable and apparent variable for free variable and bound variable, respectively.
: The idea is related to a placeholder (a symbol that will later be replaced by some value), or a wildcard character that stands for an unspecified symbol.

In this formula, $k$ is bound and $n$ is a free variable. We can substitute anything for $n$, but $k$ gets values from 1 to 10 because of the summation notation.

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{10} f(k, n) $$

demonstrable
: Provable (I think).

## Joe's Zettel ID Format {#id0820290122}

#0820290122

#zettelkasten #tag #id #format

This is my final Zettel ID format I am going to adopt, starting today, January 29, 2022. It is a 2-digit year. Why keep writing the 2-0 in front of it for the rest of my life? I'm not going to see 2100. The next 4 digits are the 2-digit month and 2-digit day. The next four are the 24-hour clock time, down to the minute only. These zettels are going to be hand-made, so I'm not going to be cranking them out within a minute.

New Zettelkasten Format: `#YYmmDDHHMM`

For example, on Saturday, January 29, 2022 at 8:18 pm, the new zettel ID would be: `1820290122`.

Zettelkasten Format 3: `#MMHHDDmmYY`. I reversed the components of the zettelkasten ID. The reason for this is so that the part that varies a lot (minutes and hours) will now be at the beginning of the zettel. The part that rarely changes (months and yearS) will be at the end. So it will be easier to distinguish two zettels from each other.

Another thing I noticed is that I have some ability to create zettel IDs that will never accidentally be overwritten by a datetime-based zettelkasten ID. Let's see what degrees of freedom we have with the minute+hour+day+month+year format.

- Minute: 60-99 (40).
- Hour: 60-99 (40).
- Day: 32-99 (68).
- Month: 13-99 (87)
- Year: 00-21 (22). We could also assume I will be dead before a certain decade and use numbers in that decade, but why bother.

$$ 40 \times 40 \times 68 \times 87 \times 22 = 208,243,200 $$

This gives us a lot of opportunities for non-datetime based zettel IDs. 

Actually, I think it's better than that. Once we set the first two digits, the rest of the digits can be anything at all. We know we won't collide with a time-based zettel ID, because we started with 60 or more minutes. These don't exist on the clock, so we are guaranteed not to have a duplciate.

- Minute: 60-99 (40).
- Hour: 00-99 (100).
- Day: 00-99 (100).
- Month: 00-99 (100)
- Year: 00-99 (100).

$$ 40 \times 100 \times 100 \times 100 \times 100 = 40 \times 10^{8} =  4,000,000,000$$

> Zettel IDs that start 60-99 are not based on time. There are 4 billion available.

## Zettelkasten ID 60-99 {#id4706170222}

#4706170222

#zettelkasten

There are 40 numbers from 60-99, inclusive.

Sequential list:

```
60 / 61 / 62 / 63 / 64 / 65 / 66 / 67 / 68 / 69 / 70 / 71 / 72 / 73 / 74 / 
75 / 76 / 77 / 78 / 79 / 80 / 81 / 82 / 83 / 84 / 85 / 86 / 87 / 88 / 89 / 
90 / 91 / 92 / 93 / 94 / 95 / 96 / 97 / 98 / 99
```

Shuffled list:
```
79 / 78 / 91 / 69 / 73 / 82 / 83 / 98 / 99 / 70 / 66 / 81 / 74 / 88 / 67 / 
71 / 77 / 68 / 62 / 85 / 72 / 94 / 75 / 76 / 63 / 80 / 92 / 84 / 96 / 97 / 
89 / 93 / 87 / 61 / 95 / 64 / 65 / 86 / 60 / 90
```

This was all generated by this Python code.
```python
from random import shuffle

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = ["%02d" % i for i in list(range(60,100))]
    print(f"There are {len(numbers)} numbers:")
    two_digits1 = " / ".join(numbers)
    print(two_digits1+"\n")
    shuffle(numbers)
    two_digits2 = " / ".join(numbers)
    print(two_digits2+"\n")        
```

## Zettelkasten ID Renaming {#id0013060222}

#0013060222

#zettelkasten #vscode

When I changed from `YYmmDDHHMM` to `MMHHDDmmYY`, I used this search and repalce in VS Code.

Regular expression search: `#.+(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})`

Replace substitution: `$5$4$3$2$1`.


## Find Replace with Regular Expression in VS Code {#id1020290122}

#1020290122

#regex #vscode

I used an interesting way to find and replace the Zettel IDs using VS Code. I wanted to find something of this format: 1020290122 and snip off the first two digits (here 20) and the last two digits (here 00), leaving myself with 1020290122.

1. Opened the VS Code Search feature.

1. Clicked on the button to put it in RegEx mode.

1. Entered in the find box `(20)(2201\d{6})(\d{2})`

1. Entered in the replace box `$2`.

How does this work? 

It matches 20. Notice that the 20 is wrapped by parentheses, so it becomes a result. The `$0` result is the entire matched string, so the first parenthetical expression becomes the `$1` result.

The term `(2201\d{6})` matches the 2nd two digits of the year, the 2 digits of the month, and the 2 digits of the day, but excludes the seconds. The last term `(\d{2})` matches the last two digits.

The replace value of `$2` means it returns the part of each string matched by `(2201\d{6})`.

Running this on the string `1020290122` results in these values:

- `$0 = 1020290122`
- `$1 = 20`
- `$2 = 1020290122`
- `$3 = 00`

As you can see, the middle one is the one we want.

![Zettelkasten Database Class Diagram](images/zettel-link-diagram.png)

### Zettel
| A zettel is analygous to a slip of paper.
| Each zettel has a unique 10-digit ID: `YYMMDDHHMM`
| Each zettel has a name or "slug".
| The body of a zettel is Markdown.

### Link
| A link is a connection between two zettels.
| A link has a reference to zettle A.
| A link has a referenze to zettel B.

### Pony ORM

```python
class Zettel(db.Entity):
    zid= Required(str)
    name = Required(str)
    body = Required(str)
    zettels = Set('Zettel')
```

This could not be more simple.

We would create a new zettel like this:

```python
>>> z1 = Zettel(name="Zettel", body="A slip of paper with an ID, name, and body (content) used as a way to record concepts")
>>> z2 = Zettel(name="Schema", body="A mental map or pattern of thought")
>>> z1.zettels.add(z2)  # Not sure about this syntax anyway
```

But this is not what I want. The link between two zettels needs a _reason_ attached to it. I would want to connect the idea of a zettelkasten with the idea of a schema, _because_ the idea of a zettlekasten _is_ a schema.

In keeping with the tradition of RDF, let's rename our Zettle class to Node and create a Property class.

```python
class Node(db.Entity):
    zid= Required(int)
    name = Required(str)
    body = Required(str)

class Property(db.Entity):
    owner = Required(Node)
    target = Required(Node)
    reason = Required(str)
```

Now all I need is a graph containing the nodes and properties.

```python
class Graph(db.Entity):
    nodes = Set(Node)
    properties = Set(Property)
```

### `__main__` for Pony ORM Zettelkasten Program

```python
# __main__.py

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Database initiation stuff goes here

    # Create two nodes
    n1 = Node(name="Python", body="The [Python Programming Language](https://python.org) is an interpreted computer language.")

    n2 = Node(name="Programming Language", body="A programming language is a set of symbols, syntax, and semantic rules that govern instructing a computer to do something.")

    # Add a property to link n1 to n2
    p1 = Property(owner=n1, target=n2, reason="is a")
```

### Simplification

```python
class Node(db.Entity):
    zid= Required(int)
    name = Required(str)
    body = Required(str)
    properties = Set('Property')

class Property(db.Entity):
    target = Required(Node)
    reason = Required(str)
```

## Zettlecasten Randomness {#id0822260122}

#0822260122

This code tries to randomize the creation of 90,000 zettel numbers per lifetime. I used it to simulate lifetimes. The results were best when I started with 10 billion and ended at 99,999,999,999. Randomizing over that size of numbers led to 25 straight lifetimes of creating 90,000 zettels without a duplicate within one lifetime.

## Crimes of Anger and of Passion {#id1621030222}

#1621030222

#wisdom #book #ethics #philosophy #psychology #marcus-aurelius

Crimes of passion are more blameable than crimes of anger. Crimes of anger are committed while reason is temporarily away. Crimes of passion are purposful.  Theft, abuse, and rape are purposefully evil, not temporarily insane from rage.

This is adapted from Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, Book 2.

## Worldview Definition {#id3209100222}

#3209100222

#philosophy #logic #critical-thinking

`axioms.pdf` defines a worldview this way:

> A worldview is a set of propositions that defines a consistent mental model of the Universe and serves as the basis for reasoned volitional action and knowledge.

Let's parse this a little.

First, it is a _set_, like a mathematical set. Members of this set are by definition _propositions_. Each proposition is a statement of the kind that may be taken either as _true_ or _false_ but not both. To be _consistent_ is not to contradict itself. It might not matter if it contradicts other worldviews. Then again, it seems like it always will, because any worldview must be _personal_ and _subjective_. It is fed into the faculty of _reason_ to plan _volitional action_. Knowledge is the map the reason uses to plan its volitional actions.

> Worldview is how the brain makes sense of it all.

> A worldview is epic, meaning it is the stuff of stories.

## Prediction in Spite of Hume {#id5116080322}

For beings who, according to David Hum, are incapable of reasoning with certainty about the future, humans seem to do a pretty damn good job of predicting the future. We can predict solar and lunar eclipses within minutes. And quantum physics apparently has great predictive power. There must be *something* to our predictions if they are repeatedly true.

#eiffel

Eiffel consists of methodology and notation:

- The Eiffel development _methodology_
- The Eiffel programming language: a _notation_ for the methodology.
- Development environments
    - EiffelStudio
    - EiffelEnvision

### Eiffel Language

Simple and readable. It supports a software development methodology. It's not just an object model.

| Class
|     Feature
|         Attribute (returnes a value)
|         Procedure (does not)

Functions and attributes are both _queries_ because the object can be queried using either one of them. A procedure (also called a routine) is a sequence of statements that can change the value of an attribute. A function cannot change an attribute, only a procedure can. This is a design principle called "command-query separation."

### Eiffel Compilation

Eiffel is compiled to ANSI C and then is compiled by the local compiler. This is why the language Eiffel is so portable: it's as portable as ANSI C.

> Eiffel is as portable as ANSI C.

## C Sharp First Program {#id3008130322}

#3008130322

#csharp #programming

This is a program I wrote from a tutorial to add up the numbers from 1-20 that are divisible by 3. I did it two different ways.

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int i;
            int sum = 0;

            Console.WriteLine("Attempt #1");
            for (i = 0; i <= 20; i++)
            {
                if (i % 3 == 0)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(i);
                    sum += i;
                }
            }
            Console.WriteLine($"The sum from Attempt #1 is {sum}");
            Console.WriteLine("Attempt #2");
            sum = 0;
            for (i = 0; i <= 20; i += 3)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(i);
                sum += i;
            }
            Console.WriteLine($"The sum from Attempt #2 is {sum}");
        }
    }
}
```

Here is the output from the console.
```bash
Attempt #1
0
3
6
9
12
15
18
The sum from Attempt #1 is 63
Attempt #2
0
3
6
9
12
15
18
The sum from Attempt #2 is 63
```

Both answers were correct.

## Worldview Meta-Axioms {#id2019210322}

#2019210322

#philosophy #critical-thinking #logic #bayes-theory #coxs-theorem

1. **Unprovability** – An acceptable axiomatic worldview must be unprovable and incomplete (to allow it to be consistent, so far). 

2. **Mathematics and Logic** – Axiom sets leading to consistent theories of symbolic reason are acceptable for inclusion in a worldview. 

3. **Real Plausibility** – Degrees of plausibility (of the truth of proposed world- view axioms or consequent theorems) may be represented by real numbers (or well-approximated by discretized e.g. binary representations or ordinal analogue electromechanical states of e.g. neurons). 

4. **Common Sense** – Plausibilities can only change in qualitative correspon- dance with common sense. 

5. **Consistency** – The complete network of mutually related axioms, theorems, and beliefs with their real-number plausibilities should be quantitatively consistent. 

6. **Honesty** – Axiomatic worldviews that are built upon and supported by an honest, open, and well-founded process are better than worldviews that are based on lies, on contradictory propositions, or on evidence corrupted by (de facto dishonest) confirmation bias. 

7. **Predictivity** – Axiomatic worldviews that (both) correspond well to the world of our past experience and predict or explain new experiences are better than worldviews that have a poor correspondence to our experience and/or have less predictive skill. 

8. **Ockham’s Razor** – Axiomatic worldviews that are simpler (e.g. are parsimonious, have fewer axioms) are better/more plausible than worldviews that are more complex, all other things being equal. 

9. **Aesthetics** – Given two worldviews of similar complexity that do equally well at consistently explaining experience and evidence, the one that is most beautiful is (marginally, narrowly, barely) best.

10. **Open-Mindedness** – Don’t ever assume that your worldview – or anyone else’s – is the best one, only that it is the best one you’ve found – so far. Never assume that somebody else’s worldview is completely wrong (if it isn’t as good as yours in some way), only that it may be less likely to be correct based on what your experience and most plausible belief set indicate – so far. 

11. **Perversity** – Beware the general perversity of the Universe; it has many parts. Allow for it in your worldview. Be humble, you know less than you think you know (no matter what you think you know). Check for metaphorical cobras under your metaphorical bed while building worldviews.

## Object-Manipulator Pattern {#id1320230322}

#1320230322

#programming #oop #design-patterns

I have this idea for an object and manipulator. The object only has data. The manipulator has skills that can manipulate a specific type of object. The object has to have an interface the manipulator understands. The key points here are data is in the object class and behavior is in the manipulator class.

Let's invent a fake example

```csharp
interface IStructure
{
    // Properties a structural engineer expects
}

class Building : IStructure

// Code to create an object of type Building

StructuralEngineer.Design(building);

static class StructuralEngineer 
{
    public void Design(IStructure structure)
    {
        // Design behavior code goes here.
        // Changes the state of building.
    }
}
```

This seems pretty cool. Let's do more. As long as the building has a certain interface, we can add other types of engineers.

```csharp
interface IPlumbingSystem
{
    /// Properties a structural engineer expects
}

class PlumbingSystem : IPlumbingSystem  

// Code to create a building

// Code to add a plumbing system to the building

MechanicalEngineer.Design(building.plumbing_system);

static class MechanicalEngineer 
{
    public void Design(IPlumbingSystem plumbingSystem)
    {
        // Design behavior code goes here.
        // Changes the state of building.
    }
}
```

### Introducing Skills

Maybe it would be better for the engineer to have skills. Each skill is a class that expects a certain interface from its objects. The target interface for a FootingDesignSkill class would have properties for length, width, and thickness. 

We could, of course, do away with the interface entirely and merely specify a class of a certain type is required for manipulation by the engineer.

```csharp
class Footing { };
var footing = new Footing();
StructuralEngineer.DesignFooting(Footing footingToDesign) { }
```

The engineer could also have writing skills.
```csharp
StructuralEngineer.ReportFooting(Footing footingToReport) { }
```

## VirtualFooting {#id4621230322}

#4621230322

#programming #csharp #engineering

To get really precise about things, we should speak of virtual system manipulated by a virtual engineer, all in a virtual environment. If we want to design a footing, we really design a VirtualFooting. It is an abstract idea only, but we treat it like it is a physical object. 

The more radical part would be to treat the engineer as a virtual person. As a virtual person, they have virtual skills that allow them to manipulate virtual objects. They might design a virtual footing first and then write a virtual report (computer file) about it.

Later, the virtual report can turn into a physical report when it is printed. Then a real person can read the real report and use it to build the real footing.

## Engineered Structure Grammar V0.0.1 {#id4920310322}

#4920310322

#structural-engineering #programming #grammar #parser

I was playing around with a programming language for structures.

```
# Hashtag is used for a comment
Project
    Name = Custom Home
    Engineer = Joe Legner

Report
    Revision = 0
    Date = today

Soil uno
    Density = 110 pcf
    Friction angle = 30 deg

Soil 1

Soil 2
    Density = 120 pcf

# uno means "unless noted otherwise"
Basement wall uno
    Rebar grade = 60
    Concrete strength = 4000 psi
    Concrete density = 145 pcf
    Height = 12 feet
    Backfill height = 12 feet
    Thickness = 10 or 12 inches
    Soil = Soil 1

Basement wall 1
    # This will get default values from the uno instance

Basement wall 2
    Backfill height = 5 feet
    Thickness = 8 inches
```

Let's try to write a simple grammar. This is not a real grammar. I have not bothered to put in all the whitespace characters and make sure the line is indented using a tab. That would take a lot of time, and I'm just playing around. I could certainly expand this later to include those things and create a proper Antlr input file. This is just for a start.

```antlr
<input file> ::= <project> | <project><report> | <project><report><components>
<components> ::= <component> | <components><component>
<component> ::= <component name> | <component intro><property assignments>
<unless noted otherwise> ::= uno
<component name> ::= <component type><unless noted otherwise> | <index number>
<property assignments> ::= <property> | <property><property assignments>
<property> ::= <property name> = <value specification>
<value specification> ::= <denominate number> | <number> | <component name>
<denominate number> ::= <number> | <number><units>
<units> ::= psi | pcf | feet | inches
<number> ::= <integer> | <decimal number>
<decimal number> ::= <integer>.<integer>
<digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
<integer> ::= <digit> | <digit><integer>
<character> ::= a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z
<word> ::= <character> | <word><character>
<component name> ::= <word>|<word><word>
<component type> :: = Basement wall | Soil
```

I would need to add a lot of things like `<concrete component>` so that I can limit what component types get a concrete strength property.

It also needs to accept string values for the properties of the project. And we will need a rule for the `today` token. Maybe functions should be in parentheses like this:
```
Report
    Date = (today)
```

I would probably add comments of the Python style, starting with a `#` character.

There will be a lot of rules required for designing things. This toy example has the `Thickness = 10 or 12 inches` rule. It might be better to have:
```
Basement wall 1
    Thickness = (design)
    Minimum thickness = 10 inches
    Maximum thickness = 12 inches
```

A new syntax idea:
```
Soils, uno
    # Default properties

Basement walls, uno
    # Default properties
```

## BNF syntax in BNF Format {#id0222310322}

#0222310322

#grammar #bnf

BNF syntax in BNF format is trippy. But it also gives me some ideas for my own engineered structure grammar. 

```

<rule>           ::= <opt-whitespace> "<" <rule-name> ">" <opt-whitespace> "::=" <opt-whitespace> <expression> <line-end>

<literal>        ::= '"' <text1> '"' | "'" <text2> "'"
<text1>          ::= "" | <character1> <text1>

## Real World Analogy Classes Schema {#id5014080422}

#5014080422

#programming #schema

What is we made classes like we manipulate things in the real world?

- `class Engineer` knows how to design a structure.
- `class Structure` represents a virtual structure, containing data about itself.
- `class SpreadFooting` represents a single virtual footing in a structure.
- `class Skill` would include instances for structural analysis, concrete design, steel design, and report building. An `Engineer` object would have one or more `Skill` objects. An alternate idea for `Skill` would be `Manipulator`, because it manipulates structures.
- `class Document` would represent a virtual document, such as a calculation or design report.

## Analysis and Design Schema {#id5514080422}

#5514080422

#schema #programming #structural-engineering #eiffel

The Eiffel programming system has very clear ideas about things, including queries and commands. A query asks something of an object but does not change it. A query does not have any side-effects either. A command, on the other hand, changes the internal state of the object. We can relate this to engineering skills of analysis and design.

- The engineering skill of **analysis** is analogous to the Eiffel **query** concept.
- The engineering skill of **design** is analogous to the Eiffel **command** concept.

## Stop Doing {#id5121010422}

#5121010422

#philosophy #buddhism

It's not "stop what you're doing" it's just "stop doing".

## Freedom, Adventure, and Pleasure {#id1710150422}

#1710150422

#philosophy #rebt

I tentatively sketched out these three goals while I was thinking about REBT (rational emotive behavior therapy). They seem hedonistic at first glance. But it's OK if they are hedonistic, because of the USA principle of REBT: unconditional self acceptance.

### Freedom

I desire to have maximum freedom to achieve my other goals in life, namely [Adventure] and [Pleasure]. This would mean eliminating as many of the constraints to thought and action as possible. What are some constraints?

- Body
    - Injury
    - Illness
    - Fatigue
- Mind
    - Depression
    - Embarassment
    - Fear
    - Guilt
    - Inhibitions
    - Shame
    - Worry / anxiety (severe)
- Social
    - Political oppression

There is a lot implied by this list. For example, to minimize guilt implies action based on kindness, respect, truthfulness, timeliness, and wisdom. To minimize health problems means eating well, exercising, and resting. To minimize embarassment means grooming, staying in shape, and cultivating interpersonal tact. I take care of myself so I can go on adventures and seek pleasures, body and mind.

### Adventure

By maximizing my [Freedom] I can have adventures in the world that may result in [Pleasure]. Adventure is about trying new things, meeting new people, and traveling to new places.

### Pleasure

Pleasure need not only be hedonistic. Here are some categories of things I enjoy.

- Hedonism
    - Sex
    - Food
    - Drink
    - Relaxation
- Learning new things
- Friendship
- Conversation

I'm not positive that [Adventure] should be a different goal. Then again, adventure seems to imply gaining new experiences, not all of which will be pleasurable. There is a risk of displeasure. So maybe I will keep them separate for the time being.

## Bayesian Atheists and Theists {#id2407160422}

#2407160422

#philosophy #bayes-theory

| $P(x)$ = Probability of $x$.
| $G$ = The (Christian) God exists.
| $m$ = Miracles happen.
| $s$ = Suffering exists.

First let us consider the views of the **atheist**.

$$P(G|s) = \dfrac{P(s|G)P(G)}{P(s)}$$

| $P(G)$ is the prior probability that the Christian God exists.
| $P(s)$ is the probability that suffering exists. The atheist thinks this is certain.
| $P(G|s)$ is the posterior probability that the Christian God exists, given suffering exists.
| $P(s|G)$ is the probability of suffering, given the Christian God exists, given suffering exists. The atheist thinks this is vanishingly small.

$$P(G|s) = \dfrac{0 \times P(G)}{1} = 0$$

The net result, for the atheist, is that $P(G|s) \rightarrow 0$.

The **theist** sees it the other way, looking at miracles instead of suffering.

$$P(G|m) = \dfrac{P(m|G)P(G)}{P(m)}$$

| $P(G)$ is the prior probability that the Christian God exists.
| $P(m)$ is the probability that miracles happen. The theist thinks this is certain.
| $P(G|m)$ is the posterior probability that the Christian God exists, given miracles happen.
| $P(m|G)$ is the probability of miracles, given the Christian God exists, given suffering exists. The theist thinks this is certain.

$$P(G|m) = \dfrac{1 \times P(G)}{1} = 1$$

The net result, for the theist, is that $P(G|s) \rightarrow 1$.

## Reportable Type Class in Haskell {#id0322050422}

#0322050422

#haskell

I have an idea that each function, when called, should report its own calculations. Then we just append each line to the calc when the time comes to run it. Isn't this how the human engineer works? He (or she) works on a particular member design and does the calcs. I think this should use the `Show` class.

```haskell
instance Show Rectangle where
    show (Rectangle h w) = "Rectangle with base " ++ show w ++ " and height " ++ show h

instance Show Circle where
    show (Circle r) = "Circle with radius " ++ show r
```

## Architecture of C Version of Determine {#id2010080522}

#2010080522

#programming #determine #antlr

The idea would be to use the following workflow to create the determine tool:

1. Write a grammar file defining the domain-specific language (DSL).
1. Use ANTLR to generate parser code.
1. Add code to react to events emitted by the parser.
1. Compile the code from the two preceeding steps to produce an executable.

Then we would use the determine tool like this:
1. Write an input file in accordance with the DSL grammar file.
1. Run the parser; each parser event emits Markdown into a file.
1. Use Pandoc to convert the (intermediate) Markdown file into the final PDF deliverable.

#determine #programming #quality-assurance

The idea of this zettel is that I could develop two independent tools that do the same thing in different ways and make sure the two give the same results. 

This would assure quality by the assumption that the probability of both tools making the same error would be small. This would increase confidence that the final answer is correct. It's kind of duplicating the idea of an engineer and checker working together to ensure a quality project.

The tools are to convert domain-specific language input file into a Markdown file. 

I had the vague idea to call them "Check-O-Matic" and "ReCheck-O-Matic" or something like that. This gives us the opportunity to use some fun-looking retro-futuristic graphics.

We can categorize goals into specific and general. General goals are vague, not measurable but still meaningful. My two root goals are general goals. They are:

| Health
| Happiness

We also want to set verifiable goals. These are often called SMART goals where SMART means: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. You might end up with a taxonomy like this:

| Goal
|   Health
|       Running
|           Run a 5k by the end of June of this year. (SMART)

## Information Entropy {#id5908190622}

#5908190622

#information

Entropy quantifies *similarities* and *differences*. 

Imagine three bags of orange and blue marbles. 

| Bag A has 9 orange and 1 blue marble.
| Bag B has 5 orange and 5 blue marbles.

Bag B has higher entropy than bag A. Why? Because if we pick an orange marble from bag A, it would not surprise us as much as picking an orange one from bag B. Picking the *blue* one from bag A would be a surprise, but *on average* over a large number of repetitions (with replacement) bag A would surprise us less than bag B.

So we can see surprise is (in some way) inversely related to probability. When the probability of an event $X$ is high, the surprise is low. When the probability of an event $Y$ is low, the surprise is high.

## Functional Breakdown {#id3020220622}

#3020220622

#philosophy

| Purpose - the "why"
| Function
| Process
| Activity
| Task

Each of these things must point to a future state. The reason to act at all is to move toward a future state. One reason for having sex is to achieve a state of pleasure for a period of time and relaxation afterward. Another reason for sex is to feel a special and unique closeness with another human being. You could say the desire pleasure and closeness are the "why" for sex. The function of sex is to satisfy the design for pleasure and closeness. The function of an action is its reason for existence.

The function of sex is to provide feelings of physical and psychological pleasure and emotional closeness. Insofar as it achieves these things, it is functional. If it is, say, done in an adulterous or deceptive way, it will probably instill feelings of regret and self-disapproval which are undesirable states. They are not states we would rationally set out to achieve. So when we act in a way that results in feelings of regret and self-disapproval, we have acted against reason. We have acted irrationally, which is to say harmfully. We want our acts to help, not harm. The reason to do something is to help someone, often yourself. We can say, then, that adultery is dis-functional. It brings about undesired results. 

All this is a very clinical way of saying that sex is good and even beautiful and meaningful when it is done in a loving, mutually respectful relationship. So sex is *conditionally* functional. It can be disfunctional under other conditions, for example if it is coercive. 

## Conditionally Functional {#id4320220622}

#4320220622

#psychology #philosophy

An act is *conditionally* functional or disfunctional. This means a particular act is only judged functional if certain circumstances are present when it is performed. Those circumstances may not occur every time, so the act may end up disfunctional on some attempts. Wisdom would mean learning how to improve the ratio of functional to disfunctional acts. We want the proportion of our acts to be functional and increase that proportion over time. That is how we improve ourselves morally. We keep doing the right thing until we get really good at it. We also make course corrections by examining disfunctional acts and trying to lessen their frequency in the pool of all acts we perform over a period of time.

An act is wrong when it is performed when circumstances make it disfunctional. 

The sure sign of a wrong act is that it is disfunctional. It may be hard to spot when it is disfunctional. We may be deluded into thinking it is functional when it is not. We may not be aware of the outcome of the act. Motivation seems to matter. The sincerely held desire and intention to perform functional acts seems praiseworthy without needing to be justified.

A process is a set of tasks. A task is performed by one role.

## Four Steps (REBT) {#id0421220622}

#0421220622

#rebt #psychology #philosophy

**STEP 1**: How am I disfunctionally feeling and acting if I let this push my buttons?

**STEP 2**: What am I irrationally thinking to make myself excessively anxious, angry, guilty, depressed, or wanting to act disfunctionally?

**STEP 2A**: What am I irrationally thinking about myself?

**STEP 2B**: What am I irrationally thinking about the other(s)?

**STEP 2C**: What am I irrationally thinking about the situation?

**STEP 3**: How can I challenge my irrational thinking? (This involves asking challenging questions that demand proof for irrational propositions)

**STEP 4**: What realistic preferences can I substitute for my irrational thinking?

## Musings on Purpose and Meaning {#id2319280622}

#2319280622

#rebt #philosophy #psychology

We want a purpose that does not make us inferior to anyone or anything else.

Life is its own purpose. If it was for something else, you are subordinating your happiness to something else.

Life is its own purpose. If it was for something else, you are saying that you are inferior something else.

You are the most important thing in the world to you. That's why being you is your purpose in life. Otherwise, if you made something else the purpose, you would be saying that it is more important than you. That's logically impossible.

You are alive right now. And you ask, "What is the purpose of my life?" No matter what answer you give to that question, you assuredly must remain alive to fulfill that purpose. That's logically inescapable. And a posthumous success does not change the logic. You still have to be alive to play the part you actually played, even if it culminates in something happening after you die. Even if you choose to sacrifice your own life, both the moment of that decision and the moment of the act of sacrifice must happen while you are breathing. So there is a super-purpose if you will. That is to be you, to be alive, to live your life. No other purpose can supersede it, because every other purpose, including selfless purposes, requires you to be alive. 

- Why stay alive? Because it's fun. Because it *can* be fun. 
- Why stay alive? Because what an opportunity!
- Why stay alive? It is beautiful and sweet and sad.
- Why stay alive? Love.

Why stay alive? To answer the question, "Why stay alive?" I can never answer it if I am not alive. I am more likely to answer it if I am also healthy. So I make health and happiness my first two goals and answering the question, "What is the meaning of life?" as the third. And I can acknowledge that no matter what the answer ends up being, I will get to the answer faster, better, and with more happiness if I am healthy emotionally and physically. I will push my ass to get healthy and use my added power to understand the deeper meaning of life. 

Wanting to find an answer to the question, "What is the meaning of life?" is enough to bootstrap your worldview, because it implies that you must go on living and implies that you should put forth effort to improve yourself. Improvement means getting better at solving problems, including an existential crisis.

Principles:
1. Staying alive is required.
1. Being happy is better than being unhappy.
1. Love is the most important thing for happiness.
1. Being creative increases happiness.
1. Being in nature increases happiness.
1. Setting and achieving goals increases happiness.
1. Having more freedom is better than having less freedom.

This is what I have so far, in order of highest to lowest priority:

1. **Staying alive is your first goal** - You're already doing this, and you know you cannot do much once you're dead, so no matter what you decide is the meaning of life, you have to be alive to experience it. So "stay alive" is the first goal.
1. **Work is your second goal** - You're already doing this one. It is also necessary, because it is mandatory to work to achieve any goal, and you -- by definition -- have a goal already: to stay alive. So you cannot get out of this one. But why leave it at that?
1. **Make it your goal to increase happiness and decrease unhappiness** - This one is a choice. It is not made mandatory because of your continued existence goal and the nature of goals, that they require work to achieve. You can choose to make it your goal, and it seems to me on its face to be a good choice.
1. **Make self-improvement a goal** - We define self-improvement as increasing your abilities that contribute to goal-achievement. Because of Goal 3, we want to increase happiness, so it follows logically that we would be better off also getting better at completing objectives. Why? Achieving goals increases happiness in human beings.
1. **Use your free will to choose the next goal** - After you have committed to all of the above, you can choose whatever goals you want! What a beautiful thought. You have turned yourself into a living, self-improving, goal-seeking machine, and you cannot do better than that. You can go conquer the world, create a world, or create yourself in the world. Use this power to create.

Happiness is not a goal but an outcome of the above.

## Zettel Numbering Revisited {#id4006290622}

#4006290622

#zettelkasten #writing

I am wondering if my current ten-digit quasi-backwards dating system is best for my zettels. I say that because ten digits is a lot. They are not convenient. What I like about them is that they are guaranteed unique. Maybe I could shorten them to a system that is more sensible by reducing it to something like one of these candidates.

### Candidate 1 - YYMMDDNN

This candidate would start with the current date. Today, for example, is June 29, 2022. So the start of the zettel ID would be 220628. The rest of it is simply an index starting with 1 ("natural numbers").

This way, each day when I write zettels, I can quickly jot down the date and nothing more. Then when I get a quiet time, I can arrange the various cards together and assign their index numbers.

| 220628 - 1st zettle of the day.
| 220628 - 2nd zettle of the day.
| 220628 - 3rd zettle of the day.
| 220628 - 4th zettle of the day.

After reflecting, I can number them.

| 22062801 - 1st zettle of the day.
| 22062802 - 2nd zettle of the day.
| 22062803 - 3rd zettle of the day.
| 22062804 - 4th zettle of the day.

### Candidate 2 - MMDDNNN

This is the same as Candidate 2, except that I would remove the year. The benefit would be to shorten even more the number. The downside is that I would have to have access to my entire collection to ensure that I am not duplicating an index number. Now I would make the index 3-digits to give me 999 possible cards per day over my lifetime.

| 0628 - 1st zettle of the day.
| 0628 - 2nd zettle of the day.
| 0628 - 3rd zettle of the day.
| 0628 - 4th zettle of the day.

After reflecting, I can number them.

| 0628001 - 1st zettle of the day.
| 0628002 - 2nd zettle of the day.
| 0628003 - 3rd zettle of the day.
| 0628004 - 4th zettle of the day.

## Physical Zettels Idea {#id51190110722}

#51190110722

#zettelkasten #organization #kb

This is a new idea to use either 3x5 or 4x6 index cards to create a physical zettelkasten system. 

### Numbering

Index numbers are the **natural numbers** ("counting numbers"): $i \in \mathbb{N}$. These are appended after the category keyword and the octothorpe.

| Format: `<Keyword> #<index>`
| Example: `Idea #1`

A second level of index numbers would be by alphabetical letter. This would be used for sub-goals, for example: 

| Format: `[1-9][0-9]*[A-Z]*`
| Example: `Goal 24A`

### Category Keywords

I'm not sure about all these, so I may revise it later.

- **Idea** - Used to record quick ideas that I don't want to categorize.
- **Goal** - This is an important one to capture goals and sub-goals. Each goal card describes a state of affairs that one desires to achieve. You can include comments and data such as the names of people who can help you and the due date.
- **Claim** - Used for philosophical or factual claims about the universe. Each claim is able to be evaluated as either **true** or **false**. *Proposition* is a synonym for claim.
- **Value** - Like a goal, but something that is not objectively verifiable. A value might be something like, "Being a good father." It is not clearly defined. It might be fun to link goals and values.
- **Project** - What if we said a project is a name given to a set of goals? You can list the goals on the project card, along with comments and data. A project is considered *complete* when each of its goals have been met (achieved).
- **Event** - This documents a factual event. It could be used to record decision, for example.

## REBT as a Philosophy of Life {#id3820140722}

#3820140722

#rebt #psychology

Source: <https://rebtdoctor.com/24-rebt-as-a-philosophy-of-life.html>

REBT is a philosophically based psychotherapy. In my view, it is more than an evidence-based approach to psychotherapy. It is an outlook on life. Said another way, REBT is a philosophy of life aimed at facilitating psychological health, resilience, happiness, and meaning in life. As a philosophy of life, it suggests that you integrate these healthy elements into your approach to life:

1. **Self-interest** - A healthy approach to life is to put oneself first, guiltlessly and shamelessly, while holding others a close second (not a distant second). Doing so does not mean that one must always put themselves first. It merely means they can do so when the matter is of sufficient importance to them and then proceeds with due ethical regard for others. This is enlightened self-interest not selfishness.
 
2. **Social interest** - A healthy approach to life is to consider the impact of your behavior on others. Because we live in a social world, it is in your long-term best interest to consider others' feelings, goals, and rights while not holding yourself responsible for managing others' emotions or their lives. Instead, strive to model emotional responsibility for others to witness so that they, too, learn how to take care of themselves and be responsible for and manage their emotional reactions in a challenging world.
 
3. **Self-direction, independent thought, and personal responsibility** - A healthy approach to life is to consider the advice and teaching of informed others, but in the end, dare to engage in independent thinking, make your own decisions, and remain fully responsible for the consequences of these decisions. Remember, no one has as much invested in your well-being and happiness as you. Take full responsibility for creating the life you wish to have.
 
4. **High frustration tolerance / high discomfort tolerance** - A healthy approach to life is cultivating patience for frustrating circumstances, internal states of discomfort, and inconvenience to achieve long-term goals and maximize your overall happiness and meaning. It is healthy to accept that work and practice are how skills are acquired and mastered, even if the process is slow and frustrating.
 
5. **Flexibility** - A healthy approach to life is to hold flexible and non-extreme attitudes leading to flexible and adaptive behavior. Avoid making rigid rules for yourself and others. Psychological flexibility enables you to adapt to people and living conditions that you find challenging and to remain broad-minded in your views.
 
6. **Acceptance of uncertainty** - A healthy approach to life is to recognize you live in a world of probability where absolute certainty and guarantees do not exist. Teach yourself to tolerate basing decisions and actions on estimations of probability. Remain open to the unknown and new discovery.
 
7. **Commitment to creative, vitally absorbing pursuits** – A healthy approach to searching for personal happiness and meaning is to have self-selected goals that interest you and then actively pursue them. This creative involvement stems from a healthy sense of curiosity. Strive to maintain this creative involvement over the course of your entire life.
 
8. **Scientific thinking** - A healthy approach to life is to strive to think logically, reason correctly, and use scientific reasoning to falsify hypotheses to understand how life itself works. Scientific thought is a tool for problem-solving and achieving one's goals.
 
 9. **Unconditional Self-Acceptance** - A healthy approach to life is to strive to accept yourself unconditionally while appreciating that you are a fallible human. Discipline your mind to evaluate your many parts, especially your behavior in the context of your goals. Avoid attempting to measure your human value or downing or condemning yourself when your actions fall short of your standards. Strive to abolish your ego. Stick to rating aspects of you which you wish to improve upon.
 
10. **Unconditional Other-Acceptance** - A healthy approach to life aims to unconditionally accept other people while viewing all people as fallible humans or born mistake-makers. REBT philosophy acknowledges that it is often helpful to rate and value other people's behaviors. It recognizes that the individual is responsible for their actions but avoids a global judgment of the other person's human value, whose conduct is the evaluation's focus. REBT philosophy holds that all standards for rating people as people are arbitrary, and therefore human worth cannot be objectively defined and determined. REBT philosophy views all people as highly complex beings and continuously evolving ones, making rating people invalid.
 
11. **Unconditional Life-Acceptance** – A healthy approach to life is to avoid overgeneralizations about the whole of life. View life as having both good times and bad times. Accept both ends of this continuum, avoid the attitude that life should always be comfortable and without difficulty, and strive to enjoy life as fully as possible despite the inevitable hassles, sorrows, losses, and burdens of the human condition.
 
12. **Calculated risk-taking** - A healthy approach to life is accepting life's uncertainty. Cultivate the capacity to take calculated risks to maximize your pleasure in life and achieve self-selected goals. Take these risks with the appreciation of the possible benefits and potential losses that may ensue. When risking taking fails to achieve the desired outcome, rely upon your unconditional self-acceptance, unconditional life-acceptance, and your ability to manage your emotional reactions and tolerate the consequences of your failed actions.
 
13. **Long-range hedonism** - A healthy approach to life is to view it as an opportunity to enjoy oneself rather than as a test to prove oneself. Therefore, it is crucial to maximizing pleasure by living for both the short and the long run and cultivating the ability to delay immediate gratification and exercise sufficiently high frustration and discomfort tolerance to achieve self-selected long-term hedonistic goals.
 
14. **Nonutopianism and nonperfectionism** - A healthy approach to life is accepting utopias and perfect conditions, and things do not exist. It is good to choose not to disturb yourself over the imperfection you encounter while striving to improve things to maximize enjoyment. It is essential to accept that it is impossible to achieve a state of perfection and far better to make improvements where possible. Perfect happiness and meaning in life may be unattainable, but greater life satisfaction may very well be achievable with reflection and effort.
 
15. **Self-responsibility for your emotional disturbance** - A healthy approach to life involves acknowledging that life's adversities and other people's misbehavior contribute to your feelings but do not determine your emotional upsetness. It is beneficial to appreciate that your rigid and extreme attitudes, which you construct and choose to hold about life's adversities, lie at the base of emotional disturbance. As a result of this acceptance of emotional responsibility, it is healthy to strive to develop adaptive, flexible, and realistic attitudes that enable you to function in a challenging, imperfect world full of fallible humans.
 
16. **Healthy sense of humor** - A healthy approach to life is to maintain a healthy sense of humor by not taking yourself, others, the world, or life itself too seriously nor without sufficient concern. It is best to feel concerned, not anxious, and not cross the line into over-seriousness associated with emotional disturbance.
 
17. **Semantic precision** - A healthy approach to life involves striving to think in a semantically precise way. Instead of engaging in overgeneralized thinking such as "I always fail" or "Everything is bad," it is better to acknowledge that you have failed in a particular endeavor or that conditions are bad but avoid an overstated description of reality. Likewise, other examples of semantic precision are thoughts and statements like "You have misbehaved this time, but you are not a bad person" and "life has many difficulties, but it is not always difficult." Semantic precision in thought and language allows for more accurate internal representations of reality and greater emotional well-being. It is healthy to monitor your thinking and correct any instances of sloppy, imprecise thinking in the face of adversity to re-establish healthier emotional and behavioral reactions. It is good to strive to discipline your thinking to be precise and scientific, which will help your effort to adapt to challenging conditions.
 
18. **Efficient use of time** – A healthy approach to life appreciates the precious resource of time. Healthy living involves having priorities, accepting that time is limited, and committing to efficiently using this resource to maximize life satisfaction and meaning.
 
19. **Maintenance of physical health** – A healthy approach to life involves appreciating your physical limitations and the importance of maintaining your body as well as your mind. Avoid all work and no play. Make time for maintaining your physical health through a healthy eating regimen, sufficient exercise and sleep.
 
20. **Acceptance of death and the process of dying** - A healthy approach to life is to accept the prospect of your death, the death of loved ones, and the process of dying. Appreciate that death is always a distinct possibility, with its hour being the unknown. Strive to lead a meaningful and satisfying life free of unhealthy negative emotions towards life's finiteness and the process of dying.

#writing #philosophy #learning

This is my idea to learn something very deeply. I'm trying it first with axiology, a peer to mathematics which supposedly sets forth the basis for all valuation.

The steps will be this:

1. Start a list with: "The purpose of this is explain \[subject\]."
1. Read widely on \[subject\].
1. Read widely on the subject.
1. While reading, write logical statements in a list.
1. Sort the logical statements into level 1 headings.
1. Sort the level 1 headings in a logical orders of presentation.
1. Under each level 1 heading, sort into level 2 headings.
1. Sort the level 2 headings in a logical orders of presentation.
1. Continue to level 3 as needed but no further.
1. Sort the level 3 headings in a logical orders of presentation.
1. Sort the logical statements under each heading in a logical order.
1. Convert the logical statements into proper prose.
1. Edit and revise.
1. Add transitions.
1. Add introduction and conclusion.

## Organization of 3x5 Zettels {#id0106190722}

#zettelkasten #philosophy #organization

### Zettel Categories or Buckets

1. **Idea** - Unsorted thought; in box.
1. **Meta** - Description of the system itself; definitions.
1. **Vision** - Description of what might be.
1. **Purpose** - Reason for being; the "why".
1. **Value** - Something important.
1. **Process** - Guide to goal-achievement; the "how".
1. **Goal** - A state of affairs I am committed to working toward; project.
1. **Objective** - An objective outcome to achieve.
1. **Records** - Description of an achievement; completed goals.

### Discussion

An **idea** becomes one of the other things. The "Idea" bucket is a buffer for thoughts. They can be reviewed and promoted into one of the other categories.

Each **meta** zettel in the "Meta" bucket describes the zettelkasten system itself.

A **goal** is a set of **objectives** achieved using a set of **processes** to uphold **values** in pursuit of a **vision**.

### Writing Process from Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle

| Follow a process for working out the structure.
|     Step 1 - Draw a box
|     Step 2 - Put a subject word or phrase in the box
|         Answers, "what am I writing about?"
|     Step 3 - Move up to the question
|         To whom am I writing?
|         What question do I want to have answered about the subject?
|     Step 4 - Move up to the situation
|         Make the first non-controversial statement
|             Certain the reader will agree is true
|             Prefix with implied or literal "As you already know"
|     Step 5 - Move down to the complication
|         Answer the reader's questions about the situation
|             "So what?"
|             "Why are you telling me this?"

## Markdown Code Formatting {#id0216290122}

#0216290122

[#python](#python) [#markdown](#markdown)

OK, now it is today. Let us try some code formatting.

````markdown
```python
def the_truth():
return "Joe Legner is cool."
```
````

```python
def the_truth():
return "Joe Legner is cool."
```

How about a little math? Permutation of $n$ items taken $r$ ways:

```markdown
$$P(n, r) = \dfrac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$
```

$$P(n, r) = \dfrac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$

Brainstorm some ways this KB could be used:

- As a blog like these dated entries that creates searchable HTML file and PDF.

- As a set of pages on specific topics that get updated periodically.

## Convert a Text File to UTF-8 {#id0304290122}

#0304290122

Here is how I converted to UTF-8:

```
## Individuals {#id0416290122}

#0416290122

[#individuals](#individuals) [#ontology](#ontology)

What if we stopped treating people as groups or even teams and started dealing with them as individuals? What if instead of credentials we sought skills?

Let's think of some skills. What about scheduling? There seem to be two skills involved in scheduling that are fairly tightly linked: (1) creating schedules with the Critical Path Method (CPM) and (2) using Primavera P6 software. One would think anyone having the 2nd skill would already have the first skill. I think at Tampa Electric there is reason to believe not many have a strong 1st skill: understanding CPM. We frequently see dead-end activities missing either a predecessor or successor or both.

## Calculus Made Easy {#id4611210520}

#4611210520

[#math](#math) [#calculus](#calculus) [#books](#books)

I glanced over the beginning of the book _Calculus Made Easy_ by Silvanus P. Thompson (1918), and the introduction first got me laughing and then immediately made me realize this book might be great.

Link to the book:
<https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33283/33283-pdf.pdf>

The laugh came from this part:

> Considering how many fools can calculate, it is surprising that it should be thought either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool to learn how to master the same tricks.

> Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult. The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics—and they are mostly clever fools—seldom take the trouble to show you how easy the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the most difficult way.

> Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. What one fool can do, another can.

The "Wow, this is good" came at this part:

> The preliminary terror, which chokes off most fifth-form boys from even attempting to learn how to calculate, can be abolished once for all by simply stating what is the meaning—in common-sense terms—of the two principal symbols that are used in calculating.

> These dreadful symbols are:

> (1) $d$ which merely means "a little bit of." Thus $dx$ means a little bit of $x$; or $du$ means a little bit of $u$.

> Ordinary mathematicians think it more polite to say "an element of," instead of "a little bit of." Just as you please. But you will find that these little bits (or elements) may be considered to be indefinitely small.

> (2) $\int$ which is merely a long S, and may be called (if you like) "the sum of." Thus $\int dx$ means the sum of all the little bits of $x$; or $\int dt$ means the sum of all the little bits of $t$. Ordinary mathematicians call this symbol "the integral of."

> Now any fool can see that if $x$ is considered as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called $dx$, if you add them all up together you get the sum of all the $dx$’s, (which is the same thing as the _whole_ of $x$). The word "integral" simply means "the whole."

> If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may (if you like) think of it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.

## Images in the Journal {#id5011300122}

#5011300122

[#journal](#journal) [#markdown](#markdown)

I created a subdirectory `images` under `journal` to put images. Here is an example of its use:

This Markdown input:

```markdown
![Anki Results](./images/anki_2020-05-22.png) Anki Results Today
```

Gives this output:

![Anki Results](./images/anki_2020-05-22.png) Anki Results Today

## Journal Script `newday.py` {#id5011230520}

#5011230520

[#python](#python) [#journal](#journal)

I wrote a quick Python script to create a new Blog post entry every day. It will have to be run manually, but whatever.

```python
#!python3.8
import datetime
import os

JOURNAL_PATH = os.path.abspath("./journal")

if __name__ == "__main__":
# Set up the filename and path
today_iso8601 = datetime.date.today().isoformat()
filename = today_iso8601 + ".md"
path_filename = os.path.join(JOURNAL_PATH, filename)
print(path_filename)

# Create the file if it does not exist
if os.path.exists(path_filename):
print("File already exists. Exiting.")
else:
print("Creating file %s" % path_filename)
f = open(path_filename, 'a')
f.write("# %s\n" % today_iso8601)
f.close()
assert os.path.exists(path_filename)
print("Done.")
```

What else did I do today? I ran shortly after I got up. Recently I've only been running 1 to 1-1/2 miles. Today I ran 1-1/2. The problem I've encountered is that my knee hurts. Whenever I start running and one of my knees hurt, I stop running. I don't chance it. But then I might rest for a few days, and the next time I try to run my knee feels perfectly fine.

I need new shoes, too.

For lunch Julie made "loose meat sandwiches" a la Maid Rite.

## Ideas for Computer Skills {#id0716290122}

#0716290122

[#programming](#programming) [#development](#development) [#skills](#skills) [#learning](#learning)

Something I want to be is a Software Developer. To that end, I want to improve my abilities over time, even though I have not committed fully to this career change. So I have a Habitica goal to work for 15 minutes a day improving my skills.

For a few days in a row, I have not really thought up much to see, so I thought I could jot down a few ideas here to stir my imagination when I have another few free moments to look into something.

1. **Python Type Hints**. It think this might be a way to make Python safer. I should learn about it. There might be a Pycon presentation I could watch 15-20 minutes a day. I would need to keep track of where I was in the video or use bookmarks.

1. **Jupyter**. I learned a lot about this already. Maybe try doing something with it? Or maybe learn more? Or maybe set up a way to easily play around with them in the future like a perpetually running server?

1. **Design Patterns**. These might be worth memorizing, too. The ones for Python are probably best for me.

1. **Code Snippets**. Consider writing some code snippets for Python, Markdown.

1. **Javascript**. This also probably takes a course. I think I could pick it up quickly.

1. **Django**. I could always learn more about this. Some topics I am unclear about:

A. Multi-tenant apps.

B. Authentication.

C. Generating and serving diagrams.

D. Adding a Vue front end.

E. Django REST Framework.

1. **Vue**. This probably deserves taking an entire course.

## A Definition of Project Management {#id0916290122}

#0916290122

[#project-management](#project-management)

Here is an interesting if not lengthy definition of project management found in Kerzner (2017).

> Project management is the planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of company resources for a relatively short-term objective that has been established to complete specific goals and objectives. Furthermore, project management utilizes the systems approach to management by having functional personnel (the vertical hierarchy) assigned to a specific project (the horizontal hierarchy).

## Project Success {#id1116290122}

#1116290122

[#project-management](#project-management) [#objective](#objective) [#scope](#scope) [#schedule](#schedule) [#budget](#budget)

This is adapted from Kerzner (2017). A project should be considered successful if it achieves all of its objectives:

- within the allocated time period,

- within the budgeted cost,

- At the proper performance or specification level,

- with acceptance by the customer/user,

- with minimum or mutually agreed upon scope changes,

- without disturbing the main work flow of the organization; and,

- without changing the corporate culture.

Scope changes must be held to a minimum and those that are required must be approved by both the project manager and the customer/user.

## Excellence in Project Management {#id0312300122}

#0312300122

[#project-management](#project-management) [#excellence](#excellence)

From Kerzner (2017):

> Excellence in project management is defined as a continuous stream of successfully managed projects.

See [Project Success] for what it means to have a successfully managed project.

## Project Constraints {#id5011120222}

#5011120222

[#project-management](#project-management) [#constraint](#constraint) [#planning](#planning) [#scope](#scope) [#schedule](#schedule) [#budget](#budget) [#cost](#cost) [#quality](#quality)

Again from Kerzner (2017):

> ...in Disneyland and Disneyworld, the project managers designing and building the attractions at the theme parks had six constraints: time, cost, scope, safety, aesthetic value, and quality.

Were I to adapt that to any of our projects, we would get:

1. Time

1. Cost

1. Scope

1. Safety

1. Quality

I deleted aesthetic value. What else could we substitute for it? How about operations value? How about business value? How about value to stakeholders? What about justification?

> At Disney, the last three constraints of safety, aesthetic value, and quality were considered locked-in constraints that could not be altered during trade-offs. All trade-offs were made on time, cost, and scope. Some constraints simply cannot change while others may have flexibility.

Which things would be sacrosanct? Certainly the last two: safety and quality. Right now quality does not seem to matter enough to worry about.

Constraints need not all be equal in importance. The most important constraint is the one we refuse to compromise by trade-offs. So this naturally excludes safety and quality, because we say we refuse trade-offs for them, too.

Could we ever have a trade-off between safety and quality? I don't think it's likely, because safety is probably subsumed by quality. Or if nothing else, they both point in the same general direction. We want the thing to be "good" and goodness by rights is going to include safety. High quality includes having a high degree of safety.

Let's take a stab at prioritizing our constraints as a general rule:

1. Safety
1. Business Value
1. Cost
1. Time
1. Quality
1. Scope

The way to think about these priorities is this: between any two ask yourself, "which of these would I not be willing to sacrifice to achieve the other?" Why did I order these this way?

In terms of a company that I would want to work for, I would want it to be one where we would never sacrifice safety for any other reason. Next is business value. The reason for _any_ project is to add business value: to reduce a risk or profit from an opportunity. So this must be second to safety, almost axiomatically.

The next four I am not as sure about. If they are not in a strict hierarchy, they seem to be _weighted_ in this order. Cost seems to be more important than time, generally speaking. Quality should be more important than cost and time, but I don't think it is for us. Scope should be subordinate to the others.

## Department Constraints {#id2016290122}

#2016290122

[#management](#management) [#constraint](#constraint) [#resource](#resource)

Could we adapt the project constraints to running the department?

1. **Requirements.** What is expected _of_ the department? What are we expected to contribute? How are we expected to behave? What functions do we perform for our customers?
1. **Stakeholders.** Who expects these things of our department? How do we know what they want? How do we make sure they approve of us?
1. **Communications.** What information should be passed around the department? What kind should be disseminated vertically or horizontally? Who does the communicating on various matters? What can I say?
1. **Resources.** What money, labor, skills, and equipment do we need to do whats required in a way that the stakeholders approve of?
1. **Constraints.** What forms the boundaries of what we are allowed to do? What limits our behaviors? What keeps us from doing certain actions? What is the right thing to when one comes in conflict with another?
1. **Safety.** When faced with a decision, we should choose the option that has the greatest reduction in the probability of an injury.
1. **Business Value.** We should only do things that have continued business justification: either capitalizing on an opportunity or reducing a risk.
1. **Cost.** We should be cognizant of the costs of our decisions and work to minimize costs to the company in the long run.
1. **Time.** We should try to do things as quickly as we can without sacrificing any other constraint.
1. **Quality.** We should create things that are functional, durable, and reliable.
1. **Scope.** We should maximize how much functionality we provide to our stakeholders.

## Results not Methods {#id1316290122}

#1316290122

[#management](#management) [#task](#task) [#result](#result) [#method](#method)

When delegating tasks, emphasize results, not methods. Provide suggestions on how to improve results. But do not dictate methods. This is easier on you and allows for people to distinguish themselves by their own initiative. You don't have to tell people how to do things. Just tell them what you want from their output. If it's not possible or needs more resources, they will tell you. Then you can decide if they are right and either provide the resources or alter your requirements.

The relationship at each level in the company hierarchy is like a contract. It requires that the lower level person provide certain contractually required services in return for a salary, benefits, and continued employment. What should this contract look like? I bet a collective bargaining agreement would be a good place to start.

As a department we could change our management philosophy to this. We first need to know what flows out of our department. This includes not only documents produced by us but demands put on the organization, such as money needed for our employees and operations. Once the outflows are identified, the directly affected stakeholders are identified. Next we talk to these stakeholders and find out what they want out of us. What are we doing well? What are we doing that's frustrating or counterproductive? Next set up sign-offs that connect stakeholder requirements to performance. The performance of a team member should be judged in terms of how much it provides value to our stakeholders, weighted according to the importance of the stakeholder.

The army requires leaders to receive training, education, and experience. I find it interesting how they split up training and education here. They are all related, right? Training is something like practicing to get better at skill. Education is learning to get better at a skill. Experience is the sum total of lessons learned executing a skill.

## Project Resources {#id0412250520}

#0412250520

[#project-management](#project-management) [#resource](#resource) [#employee](#employee) [#equipment](#equipment) [#material](#material)

I am still reading Kerzner today. Here is his list of all resources:

1. Money
2. Employees
3. Equipment
4. Facilities
5. Materials
6. Information/technology

As Kerzner (2017) puts it:

> When we say that project managers control project resources, we really mean that they control those resources (which are temporarily loaned to them) _through line managers_. (his emphasis)

Another way Kerzner states them in the same book on page 14:

1. Capital
2. Materials
3. Equipment
4. Facilities
5. Information
6. Personnel

## Interface Management {#id5862930222}

#5862930222

The Project Manager role must manage these relationships:

- Within the project team
- Between the project team and the functional organizations
- Between the project team and senior management
- Between the project team and the customer’s organization, whether an internal or external organization

## Projects as Lead-ins to Leadership {#id5885920222}

#5885920222

> The project manager is actually a general manager and gets to know the total operation of the company. In fact, project managers get to know more about the total operation of a company than most executives. That is why _project management is often used as a training ground to prepare future general managers who will be capable of filling top management positions_.

## Line Manager and Project Manager {#id5867380222}

#5867380222

Line managers are the real authority. Project managers derive authority from them, "borrowing" the line manager's resources as it were. A line manager should never act as a project manager, because it creates a conflict of interest. It will appear that they are giving priority to their own project.

## Types of Employees in Kerzner {#id5895800222}

#5895800222

- Line Manager
- Negotiates with PM to deliver deliverables
- Manages Functional Employee commitments
- Project Manager
- Negotiates with LM for Deliverables
- Functional Employee
- Does the work
- Works for LM
- Formally reports to LM
- Informally reports to PM

The **Functional Employee

is expected to:

1. accept responsibility for accomplishing the assigned deliverables within the project’s constraints,
2. complete the work at the earliest possible time,
3. periodically inform both the project and line manager of the project’s status,
4. bring problems to the surface quickly for resolution; and,
5. share information with the rest of the project team.

## Governance {#id5893390222}

#5893390222

> Governance relates to decisions that define expectations, accountability, responsibility, the granting of power, or verifying performance. Governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, and processes and decision-making rights for a given area of responsibility. Governance enables efficient and effective decision making to take place.

## Project versus Corporate Governance {#id5860810222}

#5860810222

- **Alignment**: Corporate governance focuses on how well the portfolio of projects is aligned to and satisfies overall business objectives. Project governance focuses on ways to keep a project on track.

- **Direction**: Corporate governance provides strategic direction with a focus on how project success will satisfy corporate objectives. Project governance is more operation direction with decisions based upon the predefined parameters on project scope, time, cost, and functionality.

- **Dashboards**: Corporate governance dashboards are based upon financial, market- ing, and sales metrics. Project governance dashboards have operations metrics on time, cost, scope, quality, action items, risks, and deliverables.

- **Membership**: Corporate governance committees are composed of the seniormost levels of management. Project government membership may include some membership from middle management.

## Army Leader Attributes {#id5868390222}

#5868390222

The leader attributes are:

- Character

- Presence

- Intellect

## Collective Leaders {#id5894970222}

#5894970222

Collective leaders:

- Recognize that cohesive leadership has a greater impact than an individual leader has alone.

- Consciously contribute to unifying beliefs, attitudes, and actions up and down and across units.

- Concede personal power and control to subordinates, peers, and superiors when doing so will enhance a collective focus.

- Sacrifice self-interest and personal or unit accomplishments in favor of mutual goals.

- Create and groom relationships with others inside and outside the organization that contribute to advancing goals.

- Become aware of sources of expertise across a unit and draw on it when needed.

## Strengths and Limitations {#id5898500222}

#5898500222

Instead of saying strengths and weaknesses, say strengths and limitations.

## Coaching {#id5873320222}

#5873320222

When coaching, say things like, "OK, here's what I'm trying to do, and why what you did was not helpful." Or, "OK, what you did there was really good, because it aligns with something I'm trying to do. Let me explain it."

## Procedure Writing {#id5897770222}

#5897770222

Procedures should be written by the lowest possible level of the organization. Leadership should try to define what procedures are appropriate to write, in a certain order of priority, and should provide the tools and training necessary to write the procedure well.

We should start with our core processes.

## Garage Band Recording {#id5898970222}

#5898970222

Julie wanted to record her vocals singing I Wanna Dance with Somebody, so we got out GarageBand. I dragged over the backing audio tracks that her piano-playing friend Brandon sent over. I set the levels using myself as the sound source, and then handed the mic to Julie. She recorded her part in one take over top of the backing track. I exported it to a `wav` file and uploaded it to Google Drive.

## Morning Routine {#id5886600222}

#5886600222

I have been working at home for about 9 weeks. My daily work routine is as follows:

1. Start the coffee, either in the Keurig machine or coffee maker, but usually the Keurig.

1. Get up, get dressed, take my medications, brush my teeth, and apply Scalpicin to my ears.

1. Start a new Berry Remote Team Daily Report Word document, changing the date and report number.

1. Read and process the emails leftover from the previous day, especially the COVID-19 updates from the company. Include relevant things of interest in the report agenda news section.

## Project Planning {#id5872490222}

#5872490222

These are the items that Kerzner (2017) says the PM brings to the table during planning:

- Complete task definitions
- Resource requirement definitions (possibly skill levels)
- Major timetable milestones
- Definition of end-item quality and reliability requirements
- The basis for performance measurement
- Definition of project success

Looking at this list, it looks like the kinds of things the Project Lead should be doing in the early stages of the project.

## Deliverables {#id5876700222}

#5876700222

Rather than managing by phases or any other such thing, we could simply manage projects by deliverables. Here I am using deliverables in an intentionally comprehensive way. It means defining all the work in terms of deliverables. This means not only the construction work and the engineering packages used for construction. It also means all the little deliverables that are _necessary_ to the completion of the project.

## Improper Administrative Planning {#id5886640222}

#5886640222

Kerzner talks about administrative planning. This means planning the policies, procedures, rules, guidelines, and directives that define how projects are administered. It's the ground rules for projects. This part gave me a chuckle when I read it, because it so reminds me of my experience at TECO right now.

> Improper project administrative planning can create a situation that requires:
>
> - A continuous revision and/or establishment of company and/or project policies, procedures, and directives
> - A continuous shifting in organizational responsibility and possible unnecessary restructuring
> - A need for staff to acquire new knowledge and skills

## Methodology {#id5865920222}

#5865920222

<https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/making-project-methodology-fit-guide-6085>

> A methodology is an appropriate, professional, repeatable, standardized, and documented collection of processes, tools, techniques, and templates for managing projects (Whitaker, 2012). The methodology is what you use to deliver your projects; it should reflect the size, complexity, and industry of your projects. It should be based on good practices, such as those in the PMBOK® Guide—Fourth edition. It should be easily located and understood by all project team members. It should also be subject to the process of continuous improvement to make sure it is kept up to date with any changes.

## Design Patterns YouTube Video {#id5875410222}

#5875410222

Started watching this video which is over 3 hours long.

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1FZ_Bd4DSM>

Patterns are discovered, not invented.

1. Idioms. These are the lowest-level patterns. They solve a particular problem in a particular language.

1. Design patterns. These are solutions to recurring problems that are usually language-independent but oriented to a particular paradigm. Paradigms include object-oriented programming and functional programming.

1. Architectural patterns. This is the highest-level pattern. The big picture of the system and how its components interact. This could be something to research.

## Indexing During Iteration {#id5880700222}

#5880700222

When we have a list or tuple and want to iterate over its members but also know the item number, how do we do it? Here's the right way (idiom) to do this:

```python
for index, value in enumerate(collection):
print(index, value)
```

## Scope {#id5873760222}

#5873760222

A scope is a quantity. It is a mathematical set where the elements are all the work products in the project. The types of the work products are also elements in a set of project-specific deliverable _types_. Each type should be matched to a written standard. Then each member of the project-specific deliverables should be created with and judged against the written standard.


## Projects, Deliverables, and Standards {#id1415060222}

#1415060222

[#project-management](#project-management) [#deliverable](#deliverable)

Let **department projects

be the set of projects that are being worked on by department team members. Each project shall deliver at least one deliverable.

Let **scope

be the entire set of deliverables (instances, not types) in the project.

Let **tasks

be the actions needed to produce the items in the scope.

Let **activity

be the intersection of a subset of tasks and a deliverable.

Let **activities

be the set of activities.

Let **schedule

be the intersection of the activities with the calendar.

Let **stakeholder register

be the set of persons and groups that affects or is affected by the activities.

Let the **external scope

be the intersection between the scope and the stakeholder register.

Let **project deliverable types

be the set of different _kinds_ of deliverables in a project.

Let **deliverable types

be the set of all possible types of deliverables.

Let **department standards

be the set of standards that define each deliverable type in the deliverable types set.

Each project deliverable should include a reference back to its governing standard.

For each deliverable type in the deliverable types set there shall be one and only one department standard which defines the requirements for the deliverable. Each standard may define one or more deliverable types.

## Python Generator {#id5886350222}

#5886350222

This is a new concept I've not seen. Let's look at a list comprehension.

```python
g = [i * i for i in range(10)]
```

Running this will output `[0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]`. But if we instead put the expression in parentheses we get a _generator_.

```python
g = (i * i for i in range(10))
```

This thing is neat. What it does is meters out the elements using the `next()` function or the remaining items in the generator. For example:

```python
>>> g = (i * i for i in range(10))
>>> next(g) # first element
0
>>> next(g) # second element
1
>>> list(g) # remaining elements
[2, 4, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

## Organization of Blog Posts {#id5873890222}

#5873890222

Here is a proposed outline of my blog posts:

- A blurb about the day. Not a long dissertation, just enough to kind of tell the reader what kind of day it was with maybe enough facts to pinpoint it in time.

- A series of Level 2 (`##` in Markdown) sub-sections on topics of the day. These topics are purpose of the blog. I hope to benefit from searching, skimming, and reading them.

Today's entry follows this pattern. It starts with the blurb about me taking a Friday off and proceeds into the first Level 2 subject: [Organization of Blog Posts].

## Project Management Maturity Model {#id5870670222}

#5870670222

Here is a figure from Kerzner (2017). The green checks show where we are as of today, in my opinion. We have a ways to go.

![Project Management Maturity Model](images/pm-maturity-model.png)

## Project Management {#id5883970222}

#5883970222

Project management may be defined as the process of achieving project objectives through the traditional organizational structure and over the specialties of the individuals concerned. Project management is applicable for any ad hoc (unique, one-time, one-of-a- kind) undertaking concerned with a _specific end objective_.

In order to complete a task[^taskobj], a project manager must:

- Set objectives starting with the specific end objective

- Establish plans

- Organize resources including staffing

- Set up controls

- Issue directives

- Motivate personnel

- Apply innovation for alternative solutions

- Remain flexible

[^taskobj]: objective

## Maturity in Project Management {#id5882720222}

#5882720222

Here is a definition from Kerzner:

> Maturity in project management is the implementation of a standard methodology and accompanying processes such that there exists a high likelihood of repeated successes.

Notice the use of the word _methodology_.

> This definition is supported by the life-cycle phases shown in Table 2–1. Maturity implies that the proper foundation of tools, techniques, processes, and even culture, exists. when projects come to an end, there is usually a debriefing with senior management to discuss how well the methodology was used and to recommend changes. This debriefing looks at "key performance indicators," which are shared learning topics, and allows the organization to maximize what it does right and to correct what it did wrong.

Excellence for Kerzner seems to be the optimization of performance resulting from years of project management maturity.

> Organizations excellent in project management are those that create the environment in which there exists a continuous stream of successfully managed projects and where success is measured by what is in the best interest of both the company and the project (i.e., customer).

![Project Management Maturity and Excellence](images/maturity-excellence.png)

Our first objective should be maturity, then excellence.

## Python Type-Checking {#id5894670222}

#5894670222

From this video by Carl Meyer `@carljm`: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMgmKJyWKn8>

The point of type-checking Python is based upon these principles:

1. Reading code is work.

2. Adding code for type-checking is work.

3. Skimming type definitions is _less work_ than reading code. (#1)

4. Duck-typing requires you to read the code to figure out the contract between caller and function. "What does it walk like?"

5. Type-checking does not required you to read the code. You just skim the type definitions.

6. Code is written once and maintained indefinitely. There is a large asymmetry: maintenance happens more than writing.

7. We want to select the alternative with the minimum work:

A. Rely upon traditional duck-typing.

B. Include type-checking when written.

8. We should select option B - Type Checking, because of #3, #5, and #6.

### How to Type-Check in Python

Code without type checking:

```python
def square(x):
return x*x
```

Add type-checking:

```python
def square(x: int) -> int:
return x*x
```

The type checking code consists of the `: int` part after the variable `x` and the `-> int` notation. The first indicates that the argument `x` must be an integer. The other part indicates that the function will return an integer.

We will need a **static type-checker**. The most commonly used one is maintained by Dropbox and is called mypy. See <http://mypy-lang.org/>.

To initiate a variable as an empty list of strings:

```python
self.tags: List[str] = []
```

However, you should focus on type-annotating function signatures and only annotate variables if the type-checker asks you to do it.

### Union

A union is a way to let a function return more than one type.

```python
from typing import Union

def get_foo_or_bar(id: int) -> Union[Foo, Bar]:
...

def get_foo_or_none(id: int) -> Union[Foo, None]:
...
```

The second one is very common. It's so common that they made a separate type annotation for it called `Optional`.

```python
from typing import Optional

def get_foo_or_none(id: int) -> Optional[Foo]: # same as Union[Foo, None]
...
```

### Overload Decorator

However, you should _avoid_ using `Union` and `Optional` as return types. Instead you should use the `overload` decorator.

```python
from typing import Optional, overload

@overload
def get_foo(foo_id: None) -> None:
pass

@overload
def get_foo(foo_id: Int) -> Foo:
pass

def get_foo(foo_id: Optional[int]) -> Optional[Foo]:
...

```

### Generic Functions

Instead of the overload decorator, we can also define a `TypeVar` which consists of two or more different types. The way it works is this. If you annotate an argument and return value as the same `TypeVar` the type-checker will ensure that input and output is of the same type.

```python
from typing import TypeVar

AnyStr = TypeVar('AnyStr', str, bytes)

def concat(a: AnyStr, b: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:
return a + b

concat('foo', b'bar')                # typecheck error
reveal_type(concat('foo', 'barr'))   # str
reveal_type(concat(b'foo', b'bar'))  # bytes
```

Note that `AnyStr` happens to come pre-defined in `mypy` (I guess).

### Gradual Typing

Gradual typing is for when you have an existing code base and want to introduce type-checking. It operates based upon one simple rule: **type-check only annotated functions.**

### MonkeyType

MonkeyType is a Python system to detect types by watching a Python module run and then apply type annotations accordingly. Refer to its website.

## `fswatch` {#id3363400222}

#3363400222

I added a script to my KB project that watches two directories and calls the `make.sh` script when it detects a file change. The use case is to start the `fswatch` instance and then edit the `.md` source files. Every time I save with `CTRL+s` the `./make.sh` script will run.

It works! Here is my initial script code

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
echo Watching journal/ and pages/...
fswatch -0 ./journal ./pages | xargs -0 -I {} zsh make.sh
```

## Breakdown of a Project {#id5872910222}

#5872910222

From top to bottom:

- Program

- Project

- Sub-Project

- Work Package

- Task/Activity

## Project Charter {#id5872610222}

#5872610222

I looked at a book called _Project Management Basics - How to Manage Your Project with Checklists_ by Melanie McBride (2016). It taught me something right off the bat! It said this:

> According to the PMBOK, the project charter is solely owned by the project sponsor, and it specifically authorizes the project manager to utilize resources to execute the project.

What's this mean for TECO? Well, our support request form is the closest thing we have. I would rather have all business units use a common Project Initiation Form, but instead we will have to rely on the stations reaching out to OPM. That's the support request form. There's one thing that's missing though: change control.

We need a way to control changes to the Support Request Form (a/k/a Project Charter). We should have a versioning system. The first version that is submitted to us is Rev. 0. After that, any change is given a numerical revision increase. More than one text change can occur within one revision. A revision is just a set of changes all made at the same time. When a revision is published, there should not be any other outstanding changes.

I don't understand the PMI fixation on Project Charters. Here is a document that the Project Manager is supposed to be handed. But the PM is not involved at this point. Why bother to teach her what should go into a Project Charter? She cannot control what goes in it. It must be given to her. Instead we should broaden our definition and allow that a Project Charter is any written authorization to start a project. It could be a purchase order. It could be an email saying, "please start a project to produce a new X." It could be anything. I suppose it should be written, but apart from that who cares.

## Checklist {#id5889810222}

#5889810222

Let's try to do a checklist using Markdown and see how Pandoc handles it.

- [ ] This is a to-do item.
- [x] This is a completed to-do item.

The code for this is:

```
- [ ] This is a to-do item.
- [x] This is a completed to-do item.
```

I'm going to try this in my TECO team repository. Maybe I could invent a system of checklists to keep us out of trouble. I wonder what it looks like when we do the `.md` to `.docx` conversion.

## Categories of Project Failure {#id5885590222}

#5885590222

Kerzner (2017, p. 54) defines failure simply as "unmet expectations." I would re-phrase this as:

> Failure is the condition when performance is less than expected. $P < E$.

A _planning failure_ is when we set expectations that cannot be achieved.

$$\text{Planning Failure: }P < E_{unachievable}$$

An _actual failure_ is when performance is sub-standard, but the expectations were achievable.

$$\text{Actual Failure: }P < E_{achievable}$$

Let $\Delta_p = E_{unachievable} - P$ and $\Delta_a = E_{achievable} - P$.

The _perceived failure_ is the net sum of _actual failure_ and _planning failure_. The perceived failure will be unfair when expectations exceed what is achievable. It will be fair when the expectations and what is achievable are the same.

## Risk Management {#id5880320222}

#5880320222

Kerzner (2017) says **risk management

is the key to avoiding planning errors:

> ...we believe that the major component of planning failure is inappropriate or inadequate risk management, or having a project management methodology that does not provide any guidance for risk management.

Section 2.9 of Kerzner gives a nice checklist of project failure causes. Use this as a checklist for developing our project delivery methodology.

## The Stage-Gate Process {#id5866800222}

#5866800222

Refer to Kerzner (2017, p. 60).

> When companies recognize the need to begin developing processes for project management, the starting point is normally the stage-gate process.

The process is composed of _stages_ and _gates_. A stage is a group of activities that can be run in series or parallel. At the end of each stage is a decision point: a gate that either allows the team to proceed or prevents them from proceeding until the work of the current stage is acceptable.

> A good corporate methodology for project management will provide checklists, forms, and guidelines to make sure that critical steps are not omitted.

But we should set it up so the Project Leads (a/k/a Project Manager in this context) are not the gatekeepers:

> Project managers are never allowed to function as their own gatekeepers. The gatekeepers are either individuals (i.e., sponsors) or groups of individuals designated by senior management and empowered to enforce the structured decision-making process.

## Checklists {#id5880510222}

#5880510222

A good checklist should focus on answering these questions (Kerzner 2017, p. 60):

- Where are we (i.e., time and cost)?
- Where will we end up (i.e., time and cost)?
- What are the present and future risks?
- What assistance is needed from management?

## Gatekeeper Decisions {#id5874870222}

#5874870222

- Proceed to the next gate based upon the original objectives
- Proceed to the next gate based upon revised objectives
- Delay making a gate decision until further information is obtained
- Cancel the project

## Lifecycle Phases {#id5897810222}

#5897810222

There are no agreed-upon standards for the lifecycle phases of a project or product.

![Life-Cycle Phase Definitions (Kerzner 2017)](images/life-cycle-phases.png)

In our OPM world:

![Life-Cycle Phase Definitions (Kerzner 2017)](images/life-cycle-phases-opm.png)

## Project Management Methodology {#id5895680222}

#5895680222

Achieving project management excellence, or maturity, is more likely with a repetitive process that can be used on each and every project. This repetitive process is referred to as the **project management methodology.**

> A project management methodology is a repetitive process used on each project and continually improved.

We should have two kinds of methodologies. We already do, sort of, because we do in fact manage these kinds of projects differently.

1. Projects that deliver what we set out to. This includes studies with well-defined outcomes. We could call these "closed-ended scope projects."

2. Projects where we don't know what we are going to deliver. This includes studies that are open-ended or exploratory. We could call these "open-ended scope projects."

## Project Changes {#id5887470222}

#5887470222

The way project changes should go is this:

1. The sponsor comes up with an idea to change a project requirement after the project has started.

2. OPM receives the change request and evaluates it.

3. OPM responds to the sponsor with a clear list of tradeoffs between making the change and not making the change.

4. The sponsor commits to the change or cancels it.

5. OPM documents the decision and proceeds as directed.

## Project Playbook Definition {#id5873410222}

#5873410222

The definition of the OPM Project Playbooks is "the enterprise project management methodology." Or, conversely, the name of the enterprise project management methodology is the Project Playbook. It is a repetitive process used on each project and continually improved.

Requirements of the playbook per Kerzner (2017, p. 70):

- Not too abstract and high level.

- Contains sufficient narratives to support the methodology.

- Functional and addresses all areas.

- Follows industry standards and best practices. Uses standard terminology.

- Is really integrated into the business processes.

- Uses standard project conventions and terminology.

- Has performance metrics.

- Are not too demanding from an administrative and bureaucratic perspective.

- Deviation should be acceptable when the assumptions have changed.

- The assumptions should be stated.

- Out of the box ideas should be encouraged.

- Allows value-added changes.

- Is tailored to the complexity and importance of the project.

- Not rushed. Enough time is spent on it to bring it down to the working level, not the abstract level.

- Considers bottlenecks and concerns of the user community. The user community to us is the three stations.

- Not too detailed.

- Does not take that long to use. Takes less time than we save by all the problems caused when we do not use it.

- Simple enough for our particular situation and clients.

- Has enough good metrics.

## Change Management Methodology {#id5870680222}

#5870680222

We should also have a Change Management Methodology.

Change should be managed by doing the following:

- Explaining the reasons for the change and soliciting feedback
- Explaining the desired outcomes and rationale
- Championing the change process
- Empowering the appropriate individuals to institutionalize the changes
- Investing in training necessary to support the changes

## Agile {#id5866570222}

#5866570222

Agile appears to be an iterative methodology to develop software. However, Kerzner (2017) seems to be talking about it as a general project management methodology. According to Kerzner (p. 77):

> Agile project management practices have demonstrated that project management tailoring can work. Most methodologies are made of forms, guidelines, templates, and checklists. The project manager then selects what is appropriate for a particular client and creates a flexible methodology or framework that can be unique for each client. we live in a world of adaptive environments. This is particularly important for external clients that would prefer that the framework be adapted to their business model and way of doing business rather than how your parent company does business. Framework success can lead to repeat business.

![Project Management (PM) Benchmarking from Kerzner (2017)](images/pm-benchmarking.png)

## Systems Approach {#id5898460222}

#5898460222

Kerzner (2017):

> The systems approach may be defined as a logical and disciplined process of problem solving. The word process indicates an active ongoing system that is fed by input from its parts. The systems approach:
>
> - Forces review of the relationship of the various subsystems
> - Is a dynamic process that integrates all activities into a meaningful total system
> - Systematically assembles and matches the parts of the system into a unified whole
> - Seeks an optimal solution or strategy in solving a problem

## Enterprise Project Management Methodology {#id5888890222}

#5888890222

Kerzner (2017) talks about Enterprise Project Management Methodology or EPM. In one of his case studies on pp. 86-87, he sets out in rough outline the steps that were taken.

1. Establish the number of life-cycle phases. They selected six. Others had recommended 10 or 12, but the time commitment for that many meetings was excessive.

2. Decide whether the methodology should be designed around rigid policies and procedures or the more informal route of forms, guidelines, checklists, and templates. They chose the informal approach.

3. See what could be salvaged from existing templates and checklists. The company had a few, but not all PMs used them. The PMs get to choose from among the tools available, which were all standardized in accordance with the _PMBOK Guide_.

4. Develop a means for capturing best practices using the EPM system.

5. Training.

## Reflecting {#id5879940222}

Every so often I should re-read these blog entries with a view toward:

1. Capturing action items

2. Transferring writing to other destinations

## Lean Project Management {#id5886890222}

#5886890222

Lean focuses on delivering more value with less waste. It does this by observing the following three principles:

- Muda – Remove everything that doesn’t add value to the customer
- Mura – Standardize for clarity
- Muri – Remove distractions and work at the optimal pace

For example, if you followed the lean project management methodology, you’d remove any unnecessary processes like revisions by focusing on the task at hand. You could standardize your project statements to streamline the process.

And finally, you’d reduce the number of projects you’re working on simultaneously to deliver higher quality work.

According to Kerzner (2017, p. 101), a weak project management organization is one where the line manager has more influence than does the project manager. This is _definitely_ the case at OPM and TECO.

But Kerzner adds that a PM with a stronger mastery of technical skills than line managers will make for a strong matrix structure. This is because front-line employees will look to the PM first, not the line managers.

## Stakeholder Identification Methods {#id1112020620}

#1112020620

[#project-management](#project-management) [#stakeholder](#stakeholder)

## Rapid Listing

Rapid listing
One of the quickest and most robust techniques for identifying stakeholders at the start is to:

- Gather the core team together.

- Clarify the meaning of ‘stakeholder’ on the change and why it is important that the team does not miss anyone.

- Get each individual to make a rapid personal list of everyone they can think of, giving them about three minutes to do this.

- Pair people off and ask them to compare their lists, adding new stakeholders as they occur to them.

- Move these pairs into groups of four and repeat the last step.

- Finally ask the whole team to make a joint list. This works well as a technique because it exploits the creativity of groups and word association.

## ISO 9001-2008 Quality Management Systems {#id1212300122}

#1212300122

[#quality](#quality) [#iso9000](#iso9000) [#iso9000](#iso9000) [#tqm](#tqm)

This is a standard that promotes the adoption of a process approach when developing, implementing, and improving the effectiveness of a quality management system (QMS), to enhance customer satisfaction by meeting customer requirements.

In ISO 9001, **a process**:

1. is comprised of an activity or a set of linked activities,

1. uses resources,

1. is managed; and,

1. transforms inputs into outputs.

A **process approach

is the application of a system of processes, together with the identification and interactions of these processes, and their management to produce the desired outcome.

What is important is to:

1. understand requirements,

1. meet requirements,

1. consider processes in terms of value added,

1. obtain results of performance using objective measurement; and,

1. continually improve based upon objective measurement.

This is essentially the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) methodology.

![Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)](images/pdca.png)

- Plan: establish the objectives and processes necessary to deliver results in accordance with customer requirements and the organization's policies.
- Do: implement the processes.
- Check: monitor and measure processes and product against policies, objectives and requirements for the product and report the results.
- Act: take actions to continually improve process performance.

> ...customers play a significant role in defining requirements as inputs.

This implies we need to know who our customers are and find out what they want.

ISO 9001:2008 specifies requirements for a quality management system where an organization:

> a) needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide product that meets customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and \
> b) aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the effective application of the system, including processes for continual improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.

[#quality](#quality) [#iso9000](#iso9000) [#iso9000](#iso9000) [#organization](#organization) [#glossary](#glossary)

ISO 9000 provides the terminology for quality systems. I downloaded it from LibGen today. It is in my Apple Books now.

> **customer**\
> person or organization that could or does receive a product or a service that is intended for or required by this person or organization.\
> EXAMPLE:Consumer, client, end-user, retailer, receiver of product or service from an internal process (3.4.1), beneficiary and purchaser.
> Note 1 to entry: A customer can be internal or external to the organization.

We can quickly tailor this to OPM.

**customer**\
organization that receives a service required by this organization.\
Note 1 to entry: Our customer is internal to the organization.

We provide both products and services. Products include electronic and paper documents (drawings, specifications, manuals, emails, and reports), materials, and equipment. Services we provide include:

- Project management
- Planning
- Executing
- Monitoring and controlling
- Closing
- Outage management
- Planning
- Executing
- Monitoring and controlling
- Closing
- Construction management
- Planning
- Executing
- Monitoring and controlling

- Professional services (internal)
- Electrical engineering
- Structural engineering
- Mechanical engineering
- Process engineering
- External professional services management
- Geotechnical engineering
- Environmental engineering

- Structural engineering
- Mechanical engineering
- Process engineering
- Internal professional services coordination
- Environmental (TEC)
- Procurement

**outsourced process

is a process that the organization needs for its quality management system and which the organization chooses to have performed by an external party.

## Another Project Resources List {#id5889670222}

#5889670222

Here is another resource list from Kerzner (2017, p. 118):

- Time (schedule)
- Manpower
- Money
- Facilities
- Equipment
- Material
- Information/technology

## Project Manager Qualities {#id5866890222}

#5866890222

From Kerzner (2017, p. 120):

> These qualities can be split into characteristics and skills. Project manager’s characteristics will in many cases determine how they will deploy their skills. examples of the characteristics which help to form good leaders in construction project management are:
>
> - Integrity
> - Preferred leadership style (tending towards democratic)
> - Self-confidence
> - Ability to delegate and trust others
> - Ability to cope with stress decisiveness judgment
> - Consistency and stability
> - Personal motivation and dedications determination > - Positive thinking
> - Excellent health
> - Openness and the ability to hear what others say
> - Ease in social interactions with many types of people
>
> In terms of _skills_, the following are important:
>
> - Persuasive ability
> - Negotiation skills
> - Commercial expertise
> - Political awareness
> - Breadth of vision
> - Integrative skills
> - Ability to set clear objectives
> - Communication skills
> - Management of meetings
> - Early warning antennae
> - Skills of diplomacy
> - The skill of discriminating important information

According to Kerzner, managers must understand for employees to perform efficiently:

> - They must know what they are supposed to do.
> - They must have a clear understanding of authority and its limits.
> - They must know what their relationship with other people is.
> - They should know what constitutes a job well done in terms of specific results.
> - They should know where and when they are falling short.
> - They must be made aware of what can and should be done to correct unsatisfactory results
> - They must feel that their superior has an interest in them as individuals.
> - They must feel that their superior believes in them and wants them to succeed.

My boss struggles with all of these, to put it mildly.

## System Definition {#id5872630222}

#5872630222

This is taken from David Hoyle (2017) _ISO 9000 Quality Systems Handbook_, page 110:

> **A comprehensive definition of a system**\
> System – A recognizable whole which consists of a set of interdependent parts. More specifically:
>
> a) A system is an assembly of components connected together in an organized way;\
> b) The components are affected by being in the system, and the behavior of the system is changed if they leave;\
> c) This assembly of components does something;\
> d) This assembly as a whole has been identified by someone who is interested in it.

## ISO 9001 Process {#id5863380222}

#5863380222

![Schematic Representation of the Elements a Single Process](images/iso9001process.png)

## Customer Satisfaction Definition {#id5878390222}

#5878390222

This comes from Hoyle (2017, p. 747):

> By combining definitions of the terms customer satisfaction and requirement , ISO 9000:2015 defines customer satisfaction as **the customer’s perception of the degree to which the customer's stated or implied needs or expectations have been fulfilled.**

## Steps to Measure Customer Satisfaction {#id5879810222}

#5879810222

### What Measures?

- Repeat orders: These data can be collected from the order processing process
- Competition: These data are more subjective and result from market research.
- Referrals: These data can be captured from sales personnel during the transaction or later follow-up calls.
- Demand: These data can be collected from sales trends.
- Effects of product transition: These data can be collected from sales trends following new product launch.
- Surveys: These data can be collected from survey reports.
- Focus meetings: These data can be collected from the meeting reports.
- Complaints: These data can be collected from complaints recorded by customers or by staff on speaking with customers.
- Compliments: These data can be collected from written compliments sent in by customers or by staff on speaking with customers.

### Using a Survey

1. Identify the customer’s requirements (needs and expectations).
2. Determine a representative sample of customers.
3. Determine which type of survey is appropriate.
4. Design the questionnaire.
5. Conduct the survey.
6. Analyze the data.
7. Present the results.
8. Take action on the results.

Several types of surveys can be used:

- Personal interview
- Telephone interview
- Self-completion questionnaires (Microsoft Forms)

## Gigabyte Keyboard Customer Service {#id5860950222}

## Today's Project Managers {#id2015060222}

#2015060222

[#project-management](#project-management) [#management](#management) [#business](#business)

According to Kerzner (2017, p. 131):

> The primary skills needed to be an effective project manager in the twenty-first century are:
>
> - Knowledge of the business
> - Risk management
> - Integration skills
>
> The critical skill is risk management. however, to perform risk management effectively, a sound knowledge of the business is required.

Here _integration skills_ are roughly the ability to coordinate all aspects of the project: requirements, stakeholders, communications, resources, and constraints.

This implies a few things we should train our Project Leads:

- [ ] Business knowledge.
- [ ] Risk Management.

## Incompetent Personnel {#id5897350222}

#5897350222

Kerzner mentions three ways to handle incompetent personnel (on a project):

(#) On-the-spot appraisal, including identification of weaknesses, corrective action to be taken, and threat of punishment if not followed.

(#) Reassignment to less critical activities that suit their capabilities.

(#) Termination.

## Possible Phases {#id5868740222}

## Five Interperonsal Influences {#id5894980222}

#5894980222

This is adapted from Kerzner (2017, p. 152).

**Legitimate power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel perceive the project manager as being officially empowered to issue orders.

**Reward power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel perceive the project manager as capable of directly or indirectly dispensing valued organizational rewards (i.e., salary, promotion, bonus, future work assignments).

**Penalty power**: the ability to gain support because the project personnel perceive the project manager as capable of directly or indirectly dispensing penalties that they wish to avoid; usually derives from the same source as reward power, with one being a necessary condition for the other.

**Expert power**: the ability to gain support because personnel perceive the project manager as possessing special knowledge or expertise (that functional personnel consider as important).

**Referent power**: the ability to gain support because project personnel feel personally attracted to the project manager or their project.

## Project Orientation Checklist {#id5899810222}

#5899810222

A checklist for project kickoff or one-on-ones.

- [ ] What the objectives are for the project.
- [ ] Who will be involved and why.
- [ ] The importance of the project to the overall organization or work unit.
- [ ] Why the team member was selected and assigned to the project and what role that person will perform.
- [ ] What rewards might be forthcoming if the project is successfully completed.
- [ ] What problems and constraints are likely to be encountered.
- [ ] The rules of the road that will be followed in managing the project (e.g., regular status review meetings).
- [ ] What suggestions the team member has for achieving success.
- [ ] What the professional interests of the team member are.
- [ ] What challenge the project will present to individual members and the entire team.
- [ ] Why the team concept is so important to project management success and how it should work.

## Components of Leadership {#id5869460222}

#5869460222

These are from Kerzner (2017, p. 159).

- The leader
- The people being led
- The situation

#5864400222

[#overview](#overview)

I am taking notes in the `teco` repository under Articles.

## Shuffle from the Command Line {#id5898920222}

#5898920222

I figured out a fun trick using the `shuf` command. You can use the `-e` (echo) option and trail the command with a list of words and `shuf` will shuffle them. Say you have to do three things today, but you don't care where to start. Let's say the things are errands, dishes, and laundry. You can do this at the command line:

```zsh
$ shuf -e errands dishes laundry
```

The command will shuffle the three arguments randomly.

```zsh
dishes
errands
laundry
```

Items with spaces in them can be included by wrapping with quotation marks (single `' '` or double `" "`) like this example from Duolingo lesson names:

```zsh
$ shuf -e Traditions Social 'Memories 2'
Traditions
Memories 2
Social
```

You can also use the `head` command to filter the results to pick _only one_ of the arguments.

```zsh
$ shuf -e eeny meeny miny moe | head -n 1
eeny
```

You can even flip a coin this way, but the [`flip` Shell Script] is more fun.

```zsh
$ shuf -e heads tails | head -n 1
heads
```

## `flip` Shell Script {#id3382370222}

#3382370222

Today I wrote a shell script to flip a coin. It can also pick between any two arguments that you input. For example, if you could not decide if you wanted to go to the beach or the lake you could do this:

```zsh
$ flip beach lake
beach
```

Here is the initial code which I put in my `~/bin` directory.

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh
## Written by Joe Legner 2020-06-13 {#id5870550222}

#5870550222

## If the user inputs two arguments, those two arguments {#id2666360222}

#2666360222
# become the "heads" and "tails" results. Otherwise we
## default to the words heads and tails respectively. {#id2680460222}

#2680460222
if [[ $1 && $2 ]];then
heads=$1
tails=$2
else
heads="heads"
tails="tails"
fi

## Do the flipping and echo the result. {#id2695910222}

#2695910222
FLIP=$(($(($RANDOM%10))%2))
if [ $FLIP -eq 1 ];then

## Voice Control and Dictation {#id5896710222}

#5896710222

[Here is a YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xalJD6V_M_4) on voice control.

OK, it turned out that Voice Control caused a severe slowdown of my computer. When I opened Activity Monitor, I found the speech detection using roughly 50% to 60% of my CPU constantly, compared with about 15% for the next highest. This made the machine infuriatingly slow. So, I disabled it. I can still use `F1` to dictate text if I feel like writing that way.

## Document Management Application {#id5876340222}

#5876340222

I once again decided to try finding software that I could use to organize my large collection of PDFs. Here's what I found.

- **Calibre

- Seems clunky and dated looking.

- **Mendeley

- I saw Elsevier's logo on the bottom-lefthand corner of the screen and walked away. Elsevier's business model is antithetical to my worldview.

- **Polar Bookshelf

- This one looked so promising, and it had the University of Illinois logo on the front page. The problem is they have this paid cloud service, but the service's upper limit of 12GB is insufficient for me. I have something like 78GB of PDFs. Plus it would cost me around \$15 per month even for 12GB of storage. And they don't let you use Google Drive or Dropbox instead. I thought about using it locally, but when I opened the first few documents (`.epub` files) I got an error message. Not a good experience, so I shitcanned.

- **Zotero

- I've tried this one before.

## Graph Theory PDFs {#id5898570222}

#5898570222

## Eisenhower Matrix Thoughts {#id5873330222}

#5873330222

Today I am concentrating on how to best utilize the Eisenhower Matrix for my personal productivity. I will limit to work-related thoughts. Non-work projects, chores, relationships, etc. may be dealt with some other day.

![Eisenhower Matrix](images/eisenhower-matrix.png){ width=50% }

## Daily Scheduled Tasks {#id5867360222}

#5867360222

I'm starting to think about the four buckets of the Eisenhower Matrix:

1. Do it now - for tasks that are both _important_ and _urgent_.

2. Schedule it for later - for tasks the are _important_ but not urgent.

3. Delegate it - for tasks that are not important but still _urgent_.

4. Eliminate it - for tasks that re either important nor urgent.

### Urgent

What is urgent? Here are some takes on it from the Internet:

> Urgent activities demand immediate attention, and are usually associated with achieving someone else's goals. They are often the ones we concentrate on and they demand attention because the consequences of not dealing with them are immediate.

This one makes an interesting point about urgent things being about _someone else's goals_. I guess what they mean is that my own goals will be properly planned, so they won't ever become urgent; that is, demanding immediate attention.

### Important

The word "important" needs to be expanded to "important to me." I cannot do every single thing. The intent of my new focus on the Eisenhower Matrix is to decide which tasks I should spend time doing.

It seems to me something is important if doing adds value:

- Moves a project forward
- Improves the organization
- Mitigates a risk
- Benefits a stakeholder (including me)

### Quadrant 1 - Do it Now ("Do")

What goes in this bucket? Here are some ideas.

1. An acute crisis, dispute, emergency. A chronic crisis or dispute goes in Quadrant 2.

1. A looming deadline that won't get done on time unless I work on it now.

1. Something requested of me last minute by someone in authority over me, but only if it is important. Otherwise, I should first ask them, "Is this important enough to delay the work I planned to do today?"

### Quadrant 2 - Schedule It ("Decide")

What goes in this quadrant?

1. Pre-planned project-related tasks.

1. Controlling activities for projects such as schedule reviews.

1. Providing purpose, direction, and motivation to team members.

1. Performance reviews, lessons learned, and soliciting feedback from superiors, customers, peers, and other stakeholders.

1. Project, team, and safety meetings.

1. Studying something I am committed to learning, such as Spanish (Duolingo) or Project Management (Udemy course).

1. Self-care including breaks, lunch, and exercise.

### Quadrant 3 - Delegate It ("Delegate")

Delegate stuff for which I have a comparative advantage. This means, if the opportunity cost of me doing it is higher than the opportunity cost of the delegatee, it makes sense to delegate. For example, I might be good at taking meeting minutes, but if it keeps me from doing engineering, it makes more sense to give it to an admin person.

1. Routing messages and instructions for the team.

1. Preparing agendas, submitting meeting minutes, saving to SharePoint site.

### Quadrant 4 - Eliminate It ("Delete")

Tasks that are triaged into this quadrant are time-wasters. They do not contribute to our goals. That's not to say they are entirely useless, because entertainment is important for mental health. But we are using this matrix for _productivity_.

What goes in this bucket? Here are some things that I would put here for me personally.

1. Mindless browsing of the Internet.

1. Learning trivia on WikiPedia.

## Tentative Eisenhower Matrix Workflow {#id5892990222}

#5892990222

### Receive New Request

1. Triage:

A. Is it important? Does it advance a professional or personal project, objective, or goal?

B. Is it urgent? Does it demand attention right now, or can it be scheduled?

### Start of Each Week

### Start of Each Day

## My Aspirations {#id5871960222}

#5871960222

What do I aspire to become? I do not want to stay static and just get along in life. I want to constantly improvement myself. The top of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is called _self-actualization_. It's something like achieving your full potential. I reckon if I build on my strengths, that will maximize my potential. What are my strengths, then?

**Strengths**

- Integrity, honesty, and trustworthiness
- Learning
- Cognition, analytic thinking, meta-cognition
- Problem-solving, decision-making
- Well-organized
- Communication
- Computer Skills
- Time Management
- Problem Solving
- Effective Listener
- Well Organized
- Bi-Lingual
- Musical talent

**Limitations**

- Fear, anxiety
- Self-control
- Impatient
- Does not take criticism well

My strengths lend themselves to a broad range of pursuits. It could be music. Right now I don't feel like music is the right area for my attention. We are not going to be able to play out anytime soon. And playing out is a lot of work for not that much reward, at least for me. I could do some writing or recording, I guess.

One thing that comes to mind is this: be ready to die.

I love learning. I love writing things like this journal. I love using computers, especially to get them to do something useful.

What do I love? I love a job well done. I love succeeding in obtaining objectives.

## My Statement of Purpose {#id5868960222}

- Else (non-work day):
1. Collect urgent, important tasks (UI Task)
- Family problems
- Upcoming deadlines (tax filing)
- Problems around the house
1. Do the UI Tasks
1. Review **Personal Plan

on [Microsoft Planner](https://tasks.office.com)

## Important and Not Important {#id5892490222}

#5892490222

Important
: I must attend to it personally.
: It _must_ get done.
: Doing it will move a project forward.

Not Important
: I can delegate it.
: It _should_ get done.
: No key objective hinges on it getting done.

## Open a Random File {#id5866590222}

#5866590222

This command will open a random file in the current directory:

```bash
open "$(find . -type f | shuf | head -n 1 | xargs)"
```

You can modify it to open, say, PDF files only.

```bash
open "$(find . -type f -iname '*.pdf' | shuf | head -n 1 | xargs)"
```

## Fireworks {#id5862990222}

#5862990222

Toward the late afternoon I dug down into the plastic storage bench we keep on the porch and took out a huge Ziplock bag containing fireworks leftover from last year. They included snap caps, about four Roman Candles, and gobs of bottle rockets. I turned one of the charcoal chimney lighters on its side, and we leaned bottle rockets against it and set them off. The entire neighborhood was alight with fireworks, and an eerie haze of smoke gave the world an unnatural aura.

## Juran on Quality {#id5896570222}

#5896570222

Joseph Juran is a famous thinker about quality.

> Sense 1: "Quality" means those features of products which meet customer needs and thereby provide customer satisfaction. In this sense, the meaning of quality is oriented to income. The purpose of such higher quality is to provide greater customer satisfaction and, one hopes, to increase income. However, providing more and/or better quality features usually requires an investment and hence usually involves increases in costs. Higher quality in this sense usually "costs more."

But he gives a sense 2 of the word:

> Sense 2: "Quality" means freedom from deficiencies—freedom from errors that require doing work over again (rework) or that result in field failures, customer dissatisfaction, customer claims, and so on. In this sense, the meaning of quality is oriented to costs, and higher quality usually "costs less."

## Requirements {#id5899600222}

#5899600222

Defining requirements is essential, but it must be done with care. We run the risk of (1) omitting requirements that are necessary to achieve the objective and (2) including requirements that go beyond what is necessary. Requirements that go beyond what is necessary for the agreed upon outcome should be the objectives of other projects.

We cannot remember every requirement. We must write them down, and then refer back to them at every step along the way. We can write them any of several places:

1. General to the organization
1. Standards, including TEC Design Criteria
1. Policies, processes, job aids, etc.
1. Specific to the project.
1. Project Charter
1. Project Plan

## Email to Band Director {#id5874770222}

#5874770222

We are supposed to send Tommy to drumline practice tomorrow at the high school. But we are not happy about it, because we are worried about COVID-19. It's a predicament. Either we send our kid and risk it, or he gets left behind on the drum squad. I drafted this email to Mr. Sever, but we have not sent it yet.

> Dear Mr. Sever,

> My wife and I are concerned that holding drumline practice now is too risky in light of recent trends in infections. It feels like you are expecting parents to subject their child to a small but real risk of a debilitating or even fatal disease in order to participate in band at a time when Florida is a hot spot for new infections.

> We carefully track the COVID-19 cases and deaths. The cases have spiked dramatically since the governor relaxed restrictions. It seems likely the deaths will increase in proportion, albeit delayed a few weeks.

> While the young generally seem less strongly affected by the disease, it's not always that way. There have been adolescents die from it in Florida in recent weeks.

> And the long-term effects are not yet understood. There seems to be some risk of permanent loss of taste. We would not want our son to lose his sense of taste at age 14 for the rest of his life. And worse can happen and does.

> I hope you will reconsider this decision and stop the practice, but at the very least, you should reassure parents who are (we think wisely) reluctant to send their children that there will be no retaliation for keeping their child safe at home.

> We are happy to discuss with you at your convenience by phone, text, or email.

She did not use my email and instead called him and asked him to call back. He did call back later in the evening. He seemed sympathetic, but used a couple phrases that gave us pause. He said something along the lines, "if this turns out to be as dangerous as they are saying" or something which led us both to decide he might not be as serious as us.

## Quality Assurance and Quality Control {#id5863810222}

#5863810222

Quality for a structural drawing means something like produces a structure that meets code and customer requirements as economically as possible.

## Best Practices in Quality Control and Assurance in Design {#id5865870222}

#5865870222

Here are some reading notes from _Best Practices in Quality Control and Assurance in Design_, NCHRP Project 20-68A, Scan 09-01.

The next several sections present the successful solutions that the scan team identified:

- Training and Communication Channels
- Review and Approval Processes Checklists, Manuals, and Standards Scoping and Environmental Quality Consultant Selection and Communication Construction
- Reviews and Feedback
- Quality in Existing Processes

Definitions:

Quality Assurance
: Actions to prevent defects or make improvements in the policies, procedures, and systematic actions established to ensure quality

Quality Control
: Actions to catch defects; the independent checking of work and use of control points (approvals) to ensure a high level of confidence that each product will meet expectations

## Partnering {#id5865780222}

#5865780222

What if we called our feedback loop system "partnering" as in we are partnering with the stations to benefit us both?

## Quality Improvement {#id5872960222}

#5872960222

Possible lessons learned process:

1. Read each lesson learned to a group of key stakeholders.
1. Describe what negative result occurred in as much detail as possible.
1. Ask the group, "Why did it happen?"
1. For each response, ask again "why?" until the root cause becomes clear.
1. Ask the group, "Can we start, stop, or change something we are doing to avoid this problem?"

## Red Lobster {#id5886850222}

#5886850222

We ordered a bunch of food from Red Lobster tonight. Is the first time since the COVID-19 epidemic that we have ordered from them. It was really good! We MBfgot a couple different fried shrimps, shrimp scampi, for baked potatoes, a fried fish, and green beans for something like 65 bucks plus tip.

Julie and I had an "appetizer" before we got the food, and I think I found out my tolerance is through the roof. It did not work very well for me.

Unfortunately we did not run tonight. Joey fell asleep at some ridiculously late hour, like 2 pm, so I did not want to wake him. I did knock twice around 6 pm, but he did not stir, so I left him alone.

## Dictation {#id5889870222}

I'm trying to use dictation more and more. The shortcut key is F1.

## `A->B` Thinking {#id2115060222}

#2115060222

[#critical-thinking](#critical-thinking) [#logic](#logic)

One aspect of intelligence is that it seems to be connected with word associations. It goes something like this.

1. I have a sensation of some kind: sight, sound, smell, taste, thought, or bodily sensation.

1. The sensation triggers the recall of an object from memory: another word, concept, idea, image, feeling. This is the `A->B` part.

1. Object recalled then triggers yet another word, concept, idea, image, feeling.

1. This continues until either:

A. The idea is one of action, and you go do the action.

B. You get distracted and snap out of the chain of thoughts.

C. You become mindful of the runaway thoughts and snap out of it.

D. You fall asleep.

Knowing all this, I wonder if I could not hack my brain by mindfully choosing which `A->B` connections are strengthened. I could do this strategically to get better, happier, more content, more loving, more generous, more caring, etc. I could make myself better this way.

I guess I am doing this right now, come to think of it. For example, a minute ago I was browsing a website looking for a Caltrans quality manual to read. But it dawned on me: I have been trying to "Stop collecting and start reading." The chain of events went like this:

1. I realized I was "collecting."

1. My Anki training kicked in and I thought of the mantra: "Stop collecting and start reading." This was my _trained_ response.

1. Then I realized that this was one of my `A->B` connections. This was an _untrained_ response. And in this case, it was an insight, not just a long useless chain of thoughts.

Maybe _intelligence_ when you are good at quickly making `A->B` connections but _wisdom_ is when you are good at making `A->B` connections that are helpful.

This sort of goes with the ideas of David Hume that I recently read. He says that ideas are either (1) matters of fact, or (2) relationships between ideas.

`Human Mind = {Impressions, Ideas}`

`Ideas = {Matters of Fact, Relations Between Ideas}`

`Relations of Ideas = {Resemblance, Contiguity in Time or Place, Cause and Effect}`

## Taxes {#id5883510222}

#5883510222

Today is the day we have to finish our taxes. The taxes are due in four days, and I am about half done with them. I need some more input from Julie to complete them. I will send her an email.

Here are some breadcrumbs for 2020 taxes.

- I found Form 1098 for mortgage interest on Grow Financial's website. I logged into the regular account, clicked on the mortgage, went to a summary page, clicked an **e-Docs

link, clicked **My Docs

and then scrolled down to find **Tax Document

which was it.

- Form 5498-SA does not need to be entered. It is for information only.

- Form 1095-C does not need to be entered. It is for information only.

## Home Gym Project Day 1 {#id5870560222}

#5870560222

[Home Gym Project Plan](./gym.html)

`Key objective -> requirements -> solution definition -> WBS`

Let's do a project using the techniques taught in the Deeply practical project management course on you to Udemy.com. I will explain how we went about doing this on the journal. And the project plan will be given in the knowledge base pages section.

The project is a home gym that we want to put on our back porch. During the coronavirus pandemic, I have not been able to go to the gym. Joey also wants to start working out. So we decided we would install a simple home gym to allow us to do StrongLifts 5x5.

The first step is to create and agree upon an objective statement. This is a one-sentence statement of the desired final outcome.

## Anki Discovery {#id5887790222}

#5887790222

I discovered Anki decks can be put into a hierarchy, and when you study the top deck, you study all of them. So I put all the decks under Default and then renamed it to General.

It took me 20 minutes to study 141 cards today.

## Habit Builder {#id2683590222}

#2683590222

### Objective

To create a website available from anywhere that I can use to track and develop good habits self-actualize.

### Minimum Usefulness Requirements

1. You can view habits and add, delete, and edit them.
1. Habits have maturity levels that affect how often you are reminded.
1. You are periodically reminded to make sure you are doing your habits.
1. The system is automatically backed up on a recurring basis.
1. Enough documentation to maintain and improve it.

### Minimum Viable Product Requirements

1. Registration
1. Account management
1. Hosting (less than 10 dollars per month with SSH)
1. [habits.lovebirdapps.com](https://habits.lovebirdapps.com)

### Visualization

### Solution Thoughts

Each account has a set of habits. Each habit has a maturity level:

1. **New

- Nag
1. **Developing

- Remind.
1. **Strong

- Check in only occasionally to check for lapses. Offer to increment. Lapses go back to Developing.

Desired habit frequency can be: (where $n\geq1$)

1. Every $n$ days
1. Every $n$ weeks
1. Every $n$ months

Appearance should be similar to <pinboard.in>: very sparse and spartan. Maybe I can just "plagarize" his front-end setup. The backend and the guts are the fun part, anyway.

The architecture will be a simple **front end

and **back end

setup.

### Set of Possible Features

1. Annual payment system
1. Dark mode and light mode
1. Documentation
1. favicon
1. Gradual increase in habit responsibilities.
1. Graphs of progress
1. Leaderboard
1. Logo
1. Mobile application
1. Mobile website
1. Multi-tenant
1. MySQL database
1. Never miss twice (like Don't Break the Chain, but you get one mulligan)
1. Points system
1. Product name
1. Styling
1. Tagging system
1. Terms and conditions
1. Zen styling with calm photos

### Next Actions

- [_] Prepare a WBS of all the tangible deliverables.

## Deep Project Thinking {#id5867720222}

#5867720222

A good work breakdown structure is important. If it is done correctly, it identifies all the work needed to deliver the objective, and no more. This makes it incredibly easy to know what we should be working on now and what we will have to do later.

Productivity means making progress toward the completion of any item included in the work breakdown structure. The work breakdown structure in its totality _is_ the project. Delivering these things is how the project _achieves_ the objective.

The objective is always the state of the world we want at the end. An end deliverable, then, is something that needs to exist at the time the objective is achieved. An interim deliverable is something that needs to exist between now and the end date of the project.

We can imagine the day that the objective is met. We must visualize what is in the world that was not before: new equipment, platforms, steel, foundations, piling, electrical cables, and even OEM manuals, training materials, and properly recorded lessons learned. These are the _end deliverables_ to the customer: the one who requested and is paying for obtaining the objective.

The end of a project is defined as the date the last required end deliverable is turned over. With all deliverables delivered, by definition, the objective has been met.

## Joe's Evolutionary Development Methodology (JEDM) {#id2788650222}

#2788650222

1. Decide the next baby step needed to move the project forward.

2. Work to accomplish the baby step.

3. Record a breadcrumb explaining what you did to achieve the baby step.

4. Take a step back and think about the big picture objective.

5. Return to 1 above.

## Habits Website {#id5894990222}

#5894990222

I worked on the habits website and added a feature: it now records the yes and no responses and reports them. It's very simple right now, but it does something and keeps the data which is cool.

## Elevator Speech {#id5884830222}

#5884830222

I thought about using my elevator speech to talk about how the challenge team is like an executive team in a sandbox. But Rene said to speak from the heart, so here goes.

I love working from home for a slew of reasons, but I want to focus on one: My relationship with my two boys is flourishing because I am working from home. We are closer than ever before, and at the most critical time: their teenage years.

My younger son is 15 years old. He will only be living with us for maybe 5 to 7 more years. And I'm cherishing every day we have to together. He picked up the guitar his father before him, but he has a passion for it I never had. He has already surpassed me. Because I'm not at the plant, when I walk to get a cup of coffee, he is there. I can stop by and see what he is doing. He watches Youtube videos by guitar players and about guitar playing. We can talk about them - about what he is learning. We can talk about musical scales, styles, and techniques. I can see when he's frustrated or tired or angry or happy. While he is in the house, I do not want to go back. The roots of my heart are firmly planted here.

My older son just turned 17. He is a gamer and an artist. He is an emotional and deep thinker. He met a girl, and he is trying to better himself. He has been very sedentary his entire life, and although he is thin, he is not fit or strong. He's working to improve those things.

Because I am not exhausted from two hours in traffic every day, I have the energy to run with him in the evenings. We are about halfway through an eight week program to go from the couch to a 5K. He has stepped up and dedicated himself to it. He never resists when I remind him it's our running day. I'm proud of him.

Because of working from home, we ordered a weight bench and weights. Because I work from home, we will be able to work out together. I can teach him and learn from him.

Because I have 10 more hours a week not spent commuting, I am able to take him out driving two days a week to practice for his license. While I am driving I am coaching him, and we are learning about each other. I found out he is interested in philosophy like I am. I had no idea.

Working from home, my life has been enriched. At least as long as my boys are here, which is probably another 10 years, I do not want to go back to the old way.

> Postscript: I did not go with this speech.

I did not go with it. Here's why: the other people from the team that went before me played it straight and just did the usual, "Here's what I learned from this challenge..." thing. I did not want to grandstand and do my prepared speech. It would have seemed weird.

So instead, paraphrasing, I said this:

1. This experience was like executive leadership in a sandbox. We had a challenge and an objective. We didn't have enough time or information. But we had to make a decision. Yet it was like a sandbox, because we could not screw up anything.

2. The experience left me feeling like the company is in good hands. Not only do we have existing leadership that is conscientious about running the company and cares about its employees. We also have up and coming people like the challenge team that show the future is bright.

They seemed to really like it. Archie Collins, the Chief Operating Officer (COO) called me out by name a few times and messaged me privately. No telling if he messaged others, but I will take it either way. He specifically recalled the sandbox part and said something to the effect, "I'm sure many of you someday will be making real decisions that actually matter outside Joe's sandbox." What a gratifying experience the whole thing was.

I intend to ask Rene Gallant for some personal feedback before we move on. I'm also supposed to present the findings to my performance coach (Tom Berry) and director (Jack Prestwood). I need to schedule that tomorrow.

## Drove to the Hard Rock Casino {#id5874560222}

#5874560222

Today was supposed to be running day for Joe and me. Unfortunately, there was a big thunderstorm all over the area at the time we were supposed to run. So I asked him if we could switch driving tomorrow for running today, and he said OK.

We drove down 60 all the way to 301, turn right, and headed up north to I four. We got on I four for a short distance, and then exited to the Seminole Hard Rock casino. I took him around to the back of the casino, and we drove to the top of one of the parking garages. It was good practice for him. He also drove in very heavy rain the entire time. At one point, we hydroplaned a little bit. I think it was a good experience for him in his practice.

## Pizza {#id5898450222}

#5898450222

Julie had put a chicken dish on the menu, but the two chicken breast she got out from the freezer never really thought during the day. She was a little frustrated, so I said, do you want to do something else? She agreed. We talk to the kids and of course they wanted pizza. We ordered it from babes pizza. They now deliver.

## Changed Outlook Default Color {#id5883520222}

#5883520222

I reorganized my Outlook colors and categories to accord with my system of urgent / non-urgent, important / non-important based upon the following ground rules.

Most schedule activities are non-urgent. But they can be either important or not important. So we get three possible combinations on the calendar:

- Not urgent + Unimportant = colored GREEN on the calendar. This is my new Outlook default color. Most of my meetings fall into this category.

- Not urgent + Important = colored YELLOW on the calendar. Use sparingly for things I must attend to personally, things I am leading, etc.

- Urgent + Important = colored RED on the calendar. Use this rarely. Most urgent things should be done immediately. Only schedule something if it is going to take a long time to complete it.

## Axis and Allies {#id5896770222}

#5896770222

Joey, Tommy, and I continued our axis and Allies game today. It was a lot of fun. Tommy was just talk Talk Talk. Joey got distracted a few times with his phone, but that's OK. He has a girl now. I am playing United States, Russia, and Great Britain. Joey has a pretty good game plan in the far east. He placed a factory on the mainland, and now he has six armor they're ready to attack.

I was able to capture Western Europe with the British forces. I also captured French Indochina Burma, but Joey took it back later the same turn. When I got to the United States, I put a factory in China. I also reinforced Western Europe with a lot of planes, and to American infantry from Africa.

## My Definition of a Game {#id5871620222}

## SQLite GUI {#id2713060222}

#2713060222

[#sqlite](#sqlite)

I would love to have a nice SQLite interface that is more like Excel. The nice thing about Excel is that it is snappy and easy to enter information. This is in stark contrast to the SQLite command line interface (CLI). I searched for `sqlite` on the Mac App Store and here is what I found.

- **Valentina Studio**: 3.8 out of 5, 12 ratings. The ratings are from up to 6 years ago. Last release was 3 weeks ago. The pro version costs **200 dollars**.

- **SQLite Flow**: 4.1 out of 5, 12 ratings. The last rating was from May 29, and it was a good one. Seems to be a Chinese company which I do not like given their recent track record spying on people. The pro version costs **12 dollars**. But it's much cheaper than the SQLPRo line. (Update: Tried on 7/18 and hated it.)

- **Native SQLite Manager**: 4.8 out of 5, only 4 ratings. Light and dark mode available. Seems to have one developer named Krystian Kolodziej. Last updated 5 days ago. Seems to be **free**.

- **Liya**: 5.0 out of 5, only 7 ratings. It looks like I tried this one before. Looks like a one-man company. Appears to be **free**.

- **SQLPro for SQLite**: 4.5 out of 5 with 84 ratings. This is by far the highest number of ratings right now. It is listed as #36 in Developer Tools. The website looks professional and modern. It has a copyright mark dating back to 2012 by Hankinsoft Development, Inc. Seems to do light and dark mode. There are separate apps for the different databases as well as a SQLPro _Studio_ which seems to have all the popular ones. SQLPro for SQLite only is **40 dollars**. SQLPro Premium - Lifetime is **220 dollars**. One of their other products, SQLPro for MSSQL is listed as #18 free app under Developer Tools. The SQLPRO SQLite version is #21. (Update: tried and I did not like it. I thought it would have a tabular editor, but I could not use it because of feature limitations which is too bad.)

- **Splice**: 4.4 out of 5, 16 ratings. #57 Developer Tools. Pretty professional [website](https://glimpse.io/splice/). Seems to support most databases. The word "sqlite" only appears on two pages, and I don't see a screenshot with the word sqlite in it, but it seems to support it. It might even support MS Access .mdb files. Splice Unlimited costs **40 dollars

after 2 weeks. Last update was 1 year ago which is a head-scratcher. (Update: tried and no thanks. I could not open or create a sqlite database.)

- **DB Browser**: Not on the App Store. Gave me this error: "DB Browser for SQLite.app can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software." Then I tried the previous version, and it worked. I've used it before. It seems tolerable, so I will keep it.

- **SQLite Studio**: Developer could not be verified, so Mac would not let me open it. This is probably a worthy safeguard, so I am not going to disable it to try this program.

I decided to try SQLiteFlow. No way. It's not a spreadsheet-like interface. To add a row requires me to click a `+` button every time. I uninstalled immediately.

Next I tried Splice, since it's only 40 dollars. Also nope.

Okay, okay, I will try SQLPro Studio. It's expensive, but let's see if it is worth it the way Excel is worth it. Aaaaaand it was not worth it. Forget it.

## DB Browser {#id5866660222}

#5866660222

I ended up installing a program called [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org). It is free and open source and is close enough to what I wanted. I'm content.

## Fidelity Re-balancing {#id5875440222}

#5875440222

Today I re-balanced my Fidelity rollover to 80/20 split between stocks and bonds by the following steps.

1. Logged into Fidelity account.
1. Researched and found `FUAMX` bond fund which has an extremely low expense ratio of 0.03.
1. Looked on the Analysis tab to see how much I had. The split was 90/10.
1. Calculated how much stock I needed to sell to purchase bonds to get back to 80/20. It was 12,000 dollars.
1. Sold 2,400 dollars of `FNCMX` to buy `FUAMX`.
1. Sold 4,800 dollars of `FSKAX` to buy `FUAMX`.
1. Sold 4,800 dollars of `FXAIX` to buy `FUAMX`.

The whole event including writing this journal entry took about 10 minutes.

## Refrigerator Not Working {#id5873860222}

#5873860222

Back in May we had the refrigerator repaired. Today Julie realize that the temperature was really high. She measured 60° inside the fridge. The freezer is working just fine, which means it is the fan that blows the cold air into the fridge that's the problem. Since the repair technician cannot come until Monday, we moved critical items into the old beverage fridge. That old fridge is a trooper and never fails us.

## Mindfulness of Thoughts {#id5872360222}

#5872360222

I seem to detect three broad kinds of thoughts:

- Planning
- Remembering
- Fantasizing

The first kind includes thinking about what I need to do today, what could go wrong, what I might gain by a decision, etc. The second kind includes hearing songs in my head, thinking about past events or people, recalling information that I need now or in the future, etc. The third kind is the most interesting. It often involves thoughts about an alternate universe where some aspect of my life is different than it is now.

Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be someone else, especially when I think about events like the Holocaust. This I guess falls into the fantasizing category, but also into the remembering category.

## Tommy Geometry {#id5889990222}

#5889990222

Tommy got 100 on his two final exams in Geometry! He finished the class with a solid B grade (~83 I think). This is amazing considering how fully he loathed geometry early on. We had some serious familial clashes over it. Eventually I intervened and helped him. I taught him the famous `SOHCAHTOA` which got him through a bunch of lessons and problems on the final. When we got to the part where he had to complete the square (something I never quite understood), Julie helped him instead, and he was successful with that too.

## Useless Math Problem about Probability {#id5871600222}

#5871600222

I have a strange idea to solve a useless math problem: how many rolls of snake eyes is closest to a one-in-a-million chance?

The probability of rolling snake eyes is $1/36 \approx 0.0278$. The probability of rolling $k$ snake eyes is then:

$$Pr(x=k) = (1/36)^k$$

Setting this equal to 1/1000000 give us:

$$(1/36)^{k} = (1/1000000)$$

Recognizing that if we solve $b^k = x$ for $k$ we get $k = \log_b x$ we can solve for $k$:

$$k = \log_{(1/36)} (1/1000000)$$

$$k = 3.855291627 \text{ (rolls of snake eyes in a row)}$$

This is a surprising result for me: less than 4 rolls!? Let's check our work with a calculator.

When I enter `(1/36)^(3.855291627) = 0.999900000099999` which is an error of -0.060000000061495. It's correct!

Since we cannot roll the dice 0.855 times, we need to round up or down. The error of the two values 3 and 4 are 20.433 and -0.405 respectively therefore the answer we get is:

$$\boxed{k = 4 \text{ rolls of snake eyes}}$$

The probability is about 1 in 1,680,000 to roll 4 snake eyes in a row. Surprising to me.

Now let's see how many _individual dice_ you would have to roll 1s on, $k$, to get a 1 in 1,000,000 chance, shall we? The probability of a success is $5/6 \approx 0.833$.

$$k = \log_{1/6}{(1/1000000)} = 7.7105833$$

Testing this result with a calculator, I get `(1/6)^(7.7105833) = 0.999900000099917` which is an error of -0.300800000082427. It's correct!

Rolling 7 dice gives you a probability of 0.225703000045085 or about 1/279935. Rolling 8 dice gives you a probability of 0.535900000074181 or about 1/1679616 (1 in 1.68 million).

$$\boxed{\text{Rolling 1s on 8 dice}}$$

The probability seems to be the same: 1 in 1,680,000. But is this a surprise? No.

In the first experiment, there is only one event _E_ in the sample space _S_ that corresponds to success: 4 rolls of snakeyes which is 8 6's. In the second experiement, there is only one event in the sample space that corresponds to success: also 8 rolls of 6.

To get to a perfect 1 in 1,000,000 chance, we need a sample space with exactly 1,000,000 possible experiement outcomes with only one of them being considered a success. Dice are not good for this, because 6 is not a divisor of 1,000,000. But I want it to be something handy around the house. Sure I could use my phone, but what's the fun in that. It should be a physical object doing the randomizing.

We are off to a good start already because:

$$2^{20} = 1048576$$

The error of this value is only 4.86 percent. So we have a fun answer:

> Getting heads on a fair coin 20 times in a row is approximately equal to 1 microprobability.

How can we use this to imagine what small probabilities are? Let's talk micromorts. A micromort is a 1 in a million chance of death. Living in an industrial country for 1 day at age 20 is about a micromort. Skydiving is about 10 micromorts.

Suppose we take the 1 in a million chance. We will arbitrarily take heads to be good and tails to be bad. If we flip tails 20 times in a row, we die. If we roll heads even _one_ time along the way to 20, we live. That's pretty much the same chance as 1 micromort.

[Driving is 2 micromorts per hour](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/sites/default/files/images/staff/Bruce/Micromorts_0.png). The risk of death for me at age 47 per day is about 6 micromorts according to [this website](https://charlesfudgemuffin.blogspot.com/2017/01/micromorts-risk-of-dying.html) (for Julie it's 4 micromorts per day). So if I drive for 3 hours, that alone would double my chance of dying that day. Interesting.

Suppose we want to simulate what 1 micromort is like. We can play this game.

Flip a coin until either (1) you flip a single heads or (2) you flip 20 times. If you flip a heads, you live. If you flip 20 tails in a row, however, you die. This experiment should go rather quickly, because you should flip a heads on or before the fifth flip about 97 percent of the time. At 5 seconds per flip, that is 25 seconds for the experiment. Getting to 20 flips is daunting. But this is what a 1 in 1,000,000 chance really feels like.

Here's another fun one. According to [this website](https://www.thrillist.com/cars/nation/how-likely-you-are-to-die-in-a-car-accident-in-every-us-state-the-most-dangerous-roads-in-america), the chance of dying in a car crash in Florida is 1 in 8,123 per year. Using our coin-flipping, this is equivalent to flipping thirteen tails in a row, because $2^{13} = 8192 \approx 8123$.

## Theft of Squat Rack {#id5881840222}

#5881840222

Since I cannot work out at the office anymore, I ordered a bunch of weight equipment from Amazon. Today I went on my phone to see the status of those deliveries, because many of them were delayed. Lots of people are making home Jens during coronavirus pandemic. Lo and behold, one of the packages was supposed to have been delivered on Saturday, July 25. Sadly, we did not receive it. We think it was stolen.

If you recall, that was the day that Julie and I went to Hillsboro River Park and went hiking. The kids, as usual, we're sleeping in until the late afternoon, and did not hear the delivery. There was also evidence in the neighborhood that someone had tampered with mailboxes.

I reported the theft to the seller. I also reported it to Amazon, but they said the delivery was the responsibility of the seller in this case. As of right now I have a little hope that this will be resolved in our favor. But perhaps, since we paid with a visa, it will be.

## GTK {#id5896370222}

#5896370222

GTK is the Gnome graphics toolkit. It's apparently possible to use it on a Mac with Python by installing something called PyGObject. I tried today, and I kept getting installation errors. The documentation was lousy. I gave up after about 15 minutes of trying.

If I do a GUI someday, I will probably make it using Qt. It seems to be way more well thought out, maybe because it is commercial.

## Software Decision {#id5897880222}

#5897880222

Let's continue with my software decision making using a AHP. Recall that I got this far yesterday:

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example01.png)

Let's rearrange the level of alternatives:

![AHP Hierarchy Example](images/ahp-example03.png)

Now I have 16 different pairwise comparisons to make starting with the comparison of the four alternatives under "Reasonable Scale."

The results under **Reasonable Scale**:

- Project Management: 0.06.
- Decision Making: 0.54.
- OKRs: 0.23.
- Habits: 0.17.

The results under **Fun**:

- Project Management: 0.13.
- Decision Making: 0.52.
- OKRs: 0.12.
- Habits: 0.24.

The results under **Time-Saving**:

- Project Management: 0.65.
- Decision Making: 0.09.
- OKRs: 0.17.
- Habits: 0.09.

The results under **Career Benefit**:

- Project Management: 0.19.
- Decision Making: 0.37.
- OKRs: 0.37.
- Habits: 0.07.

Now for the fun part, using the weights to calculate the priorities of the different options. I will simply used Excel for this part.

Drum roll please!

The winner: **Decision-making software**!

Runner-up: OKR software.

## Acceptable Practice {#id5863720222}

#5863720222

I found this figure in Reliability of Structures by Nowak and Collins (2000) and found it fascinating.

![Acceptable Practice](images/acceptable-practice.png)

I can say in all honesty that I only worry about two of the error types:

- Error of concept, where I don't notice that I am ignorant of something and,

- Error of execution, where I make a mistake in calculations or something.

I am simply too conscientious to make the other errors.

![A Fault Tree for Concrete](images/fault-tree.png)

## New Concept of Success {#id5890320222}

#5890320222

In the following, I will use system to represent an organization.

What if the system's success was measured as the sum of the opinions of its stakeholders? Or more rightly, maybe it should be the degree to which the stakeholder's opinion is positive. It should be weighted by the influence that the stakeholder's satisfaction or dissatisfaction has over the continued operation of the system.

Each stakeholder demands one or more things from the system. The shareholders demand return on investment. Or perhaps they demand the feeling of certainty that there will be future return on investment. Employees demand as high of pay as possible, confidence in their own safety, job security, personal fulfillment, enjoyment of time spent at work.

But let's think about the word reliable. If something is reliable, you can count on the fact that its capacity will be there when demanded. It's even easier than that. A person _expects_ that everything will fail at some point. After all, they expect to die, so they expect that their demand to continue living will not be supplied by their own body in the future. So humans are okay with failure, just - not too soon.

If they buy a car, they do not think it was a bad purchase if the car lasts 12 years. But if it's irreparably inoperable within 4 months, they will want their money back.

Now we can go back to our thoughts about reliability and update them. Something is reliable if supply meets or exceeds demand for at least as long as the stakeholder expects. It does so efficiently if it just _barely_ meets demand the entire time. That's too much to hope for, but we can say that we want to minimize the gap between demand and supply as long as supply remains on top. Why is this? It's because supply costs money. Or more rightly, supply consumes resources. Because money is exchanged for goods and services. Resources, then, are just the goods and services.

I think the right way to think about the success of a system is this:

> Is the system capable of suppling enough for all the demands on it sufficiently to continue to survive?

If it does not meet demand, it will die. Here die can mean different things for different systems. For a living system, the word die is obvious. For a business, it means to go out of business. For a machine, it means get thrown away. For a machine _design_ it means continued to be actively used.

Maybe this is what the viability axiom is about. A system fails to be a system if it dies. It's not a dead system -- it is not a system at all. Maybe this is what really defines a system.

**A system is a set of components that interact to supply the demand of one or more stakeholders well enough in the opinion of a stakeholder for the stakeholder to keep it in their service.**

By this definition, once it is destroyed or disposed of, it ceases to be a system. I think this is OK. It's like saying a living thing is no longer that thing after it dies. Thus a system is a living thing. A living thing is a system.

A natural system is the same thing, except without a stakeholder. Why is this? Because for a natural system, continued existence is an axiom.

Maybe that's the definition of a human. A human is the only living thing that can make a non-natural system. Or maybe their existence is hierarchically subordinate to humans existing.

It's not that their systems are not "natural" meaning not belonging to the natural world. It means that their systems' existence is based upon their own subjective judgement.

A system is an instance of something which was created by an existing system and has until now kept itself operating.

So let's take a particular cordless screwdriver. I mean one single one that was produced by a manufacturer and ended up on a shelf. I don't mean a make or model. The instance of the screwdriver was produced by a system: a business created by humans. It was also produced by a set of machines and tools that were created by humans. At the end of the day, all the systems created by humans are technology. The humans are natural, but their output is what we call technology. But what about beaver technology? I think it's okay to also call that technology.

I would fight the temptation to consider a system to be the _idea_ of a cordless screwdriver. It should be thought of as the _physical manifestation_ of the idea of a cordless screwdriver. An idea is only real because it is carried in the heads of real beings. If all the beings that held that idea died, and it was not recorded in a way that could be retrieved later, it would be annihilated. I don't mean killed; I mean annihilated -- just the same as the world was before it ever existed.

The design of a cordless screwdriver is also a system. As long as it continues to be used and kept in service, it continues to be a system.

Maybe that's the difference between dead and annihilated. Dead means the world is different than it was before it existed. Annihilated means the world is no different than it would have been had it never existed. Or the world has no memory of it having existed before. The life force of the body is annihilated. The physical body is dead.

## Maximize Value of the Organization {#id2673830222}

#2673830222

The goal of management should be to maximize the value of the organization. This is not easy because value is in the eye of the beholder. Who should decide if we are adding value?

## Benefit-Cost Analysis Steps {#id5886410222}

#5886410222

1. Define the problem. What is the dilemma we are facing?

1. Identify possible alternatives, always including "do nothing."

1. For each benefit, estimate the benefits, $B$, and estimate the costs, $C$, and use them to calculate the net benefits $(B - C)$. Discount costs back to a common time period such as _the present_.

1. Compare $(B-C)$ for each option including "do nothing."

1. Select the best option which is the one with the greatest net benefits $(B - C)$.

## Cleaning {#id5870650222}

Today I did my weekly Sunday cleaning routine, cleaning for 1 hours. Here's what I did:

- Vacuumed Master Suite
- Vacuumed living room
- Vacuumed family room
- Vacuumed kitchen
- Vacuumed hall outside the kids' room.
- Cleaned the kids' mirror.
- Cleaned the front door and side light windows.
- Sorted objects from the living room and family room.
- Processed my In Box.
- Removed the table top and stool tops from the old round table.

## Lunch {#id5884500222}

#5884500222

For lunch we had grilled chicken with Open Pit barbecue sauce and Rice-A-Roni. This time I cooked the chicken a little different. I set up the grill for indirect cooking, but then I cooked the chicken about half the time directly. Only toward the end when I was basting them in sauce did I move them to the indirect area of the grill. I think the chicken turned out better than the last few times.

I can use it to experiment a little. What does the attacker's winning percentage do if I add 1 more armor?

## Electricity and Human Motivation {#id5860590222}

#5860590222

Electricity flows through a conductor when there is a difference in charge between the two ends. This circumstance is alternately called:

- Difference in potential
- Voltage
- Electromotive force

My understanding of electricity is primitive and fairly naive, but it's close enough for what I'm about to say. Perhaps as I learn more about electricity the following analogy will be improved upon.

Maybe similarly humans are motivated by a difference in emotions. In this analogy:

- Conductor = length of time
- Let time be represented by $t$ where $t=0$ is the present moment, $t>0$ is the future, and $t<0$ is the past. Note that only $t=0$ truly exists. The others are in your head.
- An emotion exists at $t=0$, call it $E_0$.
- A perceived future emotion exists at time $t$, $E_t$. This emotion is felt by the body as excitement, fear, longing, curiosity, or other action-inducing emotions.
- A person is motivated to act when $E_0 \neq E_t$.
- A person is not motivated to act when $E_0 \approx E_t$. They do not want things to be different than they are now. It is the state of contentedness. This is the Buddha's state of mind. How he achieved it is kind of outlined below.

Maybe we could call this difference in potential the **emotional-motivational force**. Perhaps it would be: $F = E_t - E_0$.

We can let positive emotions have a positive sign and negative emotions have a negative sign.

- An emotion is positive when $E_i > 0$.
- An emotion is negative when $E_i < 0$.
- An emotion is neutral when $E_i \approx 0$.  I use approximately because it's probably not possible to achieve perfect neutrality unless you are the Buddha.

While a Buddhist monk is sitting breathing for long periods of time, the monk's $F = 0$, presumably because $E_0 \approx 0$ and $E_t$ is undefined, because they are not thinking about the future. They are in the moment.

**Note:** Somebody has probably already thought of all this. I cannot recall ever having seen it, but I might have and forgot the incident.

## Virtual Happy Hour {#id5863680222}

#5863680222

I hosted a virtual happy hour for TECO employees tonight. Only a few showed up: Veronica, Paul, David, Amy, and me and Julie. It was so-so. At the end Julie did some Mad Gab cards for David, Paul, and Kristen, and that part was the best part.

We ordered pizzas again, and we are going to order them on Sunday, too when Joey and I complete our last run.

## LegLib on PyPi {#id5873630222}

#5873630222

For the first time in my life I added a package to PyPi.

<https://pypi.org/project/leglib/0.0.4/>

## Crosman Pistol O-Ring {#id5880420222}

#5880420222

We had ordered some .22 pellets for an old Crossman pistol that Terry gave the boys. It is a Crosman Mark 1 Target pistol. We received the pellets today. Joe and I tried to install a cartridge, but the O-ring was old, brittle, and cracked. All the gas leaked out.

![Crosman Pistol O-Ring Measurements](images/crosman-o-ring-measurements.png)

It looks like the outside diameter is about 3/4-inch and the width is 3/32-inch.

I found a chart of O-rings on the [allorings.com website](https://www.allorings.com/userAssets/file/USAStandardSizes02.pdf) and entered it using 3/32 = 0.09375 for the value of C.S. and 3/4 = 0.750 for the value of O.D.

Here are the options and the error in the measurements:

**Size 113**: C.S. = 0.103 inch and O.D. = 0.755 inch. The error for C.S. then is $|0.103 - 0.09375|/0.103 \times 100 = 9$ percent and the error for O.D. is $(0.755 - 0.750)/0.755 \times 100 = 0.7$ percent. Not bad.

**Size 016**: C.S. = 0.70 inch and O.D. = 0.754 inch. The error for C.S. then is $|0.070 - 0.09375|/0.070 \times 100 = 34$ percent and the error for O.D. is $(0.754 - 0.750)/0.754 \times 100 = 0.5$ percent.

Visually it looks like it could be a little over 3/32 inch anyway, so I think Size 113 is the correct size.

## OBS Install {#id5898610222}

#5898610222

I am going to help Julie get better sound and video on her OBS. I downloaded it and installed it.

![OBS Auto-Configuration Wizard Results](images/obs-auto-config-2020-08-18.png)

## OBS Audio Settings {#id5868720222}

#5868720222

Here are some tips I've already gleaned from watching YouTube videos.

- Add noise gate if in a loud environment. This would probably be appropriate for me with Julie. The Close Threshold should be a little higher than the Open Threshold.
- In a somewhat noisy background, use noise suppression.
- Add compressor. Leave the defaults.
- Peak level should be -3 dB. Zero is the far right. To get to the -3 dB, add a Gain filter.
- Last filter we need is the limiter. The threshold should be -3 dB.

## The Most Important Lesson {#id5891930222}

#5891930222

The most important lesson is that the fear of suffering is already suffering. So you should never fear. You can trust that you will not _try_ to do something that causes suffering. If you believe this, you will trust yourself and need not fear the suffering.

> Let me take fear of failure as an example.  I know right now, as you’re reading this, you’re dreaming of something.  You long for a change.

> You’re imagining what life could be like “if” you could have all that you dreamed of.

> But you’re terrified of trying, because by trying you might, just might, not get there and failing for you is just not an option. You’re worried what ‘people’ might think.  You’re scared you’ll be judged.  You’re also petrified that your own high standards won’t be met.

> And so, you do nothing at all.
Because if you tried and failed, well you’d be right back to where you are now.
Which is exactly the same place that you’re terrified of being if you don’t succeed.

- Don't be afraid of others judging you negatively or you will already be suffering.

- Don't be afraid of judging yourself negatively or you will already be suffering.

- Don't be afraid of others Julie you negatively or you will already be suffering.

This is probably what **anxiety

is all about: people suffering because they are always afraid of future suffering of any kind, even suffering because you are afraid. Do not be afraid, and you will not suffer.

When you feel like saying, "Oh no, I will forget this," you are already suffering. If you worry your future self will say, "Boy, was I stupid," you are already suffering. Confidence is feeling you will succeed, even when you cannot be sure, because you do not fear the uncertainty. You live in the now.

You should fantasize, but only if you can do it without fear that it will never come true. Again, this is confidence. It's wanting without demanding. It's wanting, but being open to not getting.

Being afraid of being too empathetic is already suffering.

Thinking of the next right thing to do rationally is not based upon fear.# 2020-08-27 First Run after Couch to 5K

I was finally able to get Joey up actually he got up at a reasonable hour this morning, so we went running. We looked at his app, and found that we ran 3.2 miles in 30 minutes. So rather than run 35 minutes, we just ran for 30 minutes. It was good, we talked a little bit about meditation and anxiety and subjects like that. When we got home, Julie made Sriracha bacon in the oven. Then I got to work.

## First Principles {#id0214060222}

#0214060222

[#philosophy](#philosophy) [#metaphysics](#metaphysics) [#ontology](#ontology)

What do I believe without question?

1. There is a physical universe.

1. Time only moves forward.

## Causation {#id5891720222}

#5891720222

For an event A to _cause_ an event B, the following must be true:

1. A occurs prior to B in time.

1. There is a chain of physical connections between the matter involved in event A and the matter involved in event B.


## Animal Simulation Thoughts {#id5878650222}

#5878650222

- Each animal should have a reservoir of energy.

- Energy is derived from food sources: plants or other animals.

- A larger body requires more energy. There is probably a power law for this.

- There would be losses of energy in each feeding. Only a fraction of the energy stored in the body would get added to the predator's body.

- There would be sensing capabilities.

An animal's day would include either resting all day or hunting for food or courting (hunting) a mate.

```python

class Animal:

def __init__(self):
self.energy = 0     # kilojoules
self.x = 0          # meters
self.y = 0          # meters
self.z = 0          # meters
self.mass = 0       # kilograms
self.volume = 0     # cubic meters
# self.z = for flight later

## Model Engineering Calculation {#id0115060222}

#0115060222

[#engineering](#engineering) [#model](#model) [#calculation](#calculation)

If I was going to model an engineering calculation, I would want to model it like this:

```
Cover
Frontmatter
Table of Contents
Mainmatter
Section
Paragraph
Paragraph
Section
Section
Paragraph
Paragraph
Paragraph
Section
Paragraph
Backmatter
Index
```

A `paragraph` could be a few sentences in prose or it could be a mathematical equation.

The way the thing could work would be like this. For any one problem you would need the problem input, a procedure, a series of templates for steps in the procedure, and an engine for doing the processing.

There would be a procedure to design a steel beam under a certain edition of the AISC Specification, for example. It might be very complex, for it needs to be able to branch off for hollow structural sections, wide flanges, angles, etc.

A procedure can depend upon another procedure. For example, the flexural design procedure may depend on the section categorization procedure (compact, non-compact, etc. at the same time as the axial design procedure and the flexural analysis procedure.

A procedure has two kinds of requirements: its own, and the requirements of its dependencies (sub-procedures).

```zsh
$ python -m pycalcs input.yml > output.md
$ pandoc ... output.md -o output.pdf
```

The steps involved in this could be the major components.

1. Parse the input file into input data.
2. Select the design procedure called for in the input file.
3. Go through the procedure, using the input data.

The main triage section only needs to know what version of the program you are expecting and what design procedure you need. The rest of the input file contents are data for the procedure. They will be validated against the requirements of the procedure: the procedure input specification.

Input can be complex like a YAML document. The first step of the solution engine is to validate the input and throw an error if it is invalid.

```python
def parse(input_file):
input_data, procedure_name = process_yml_file(input_file)
return input_data, procedure_name

if __name__ == "__main__":
input_data, procedure_name = parse(input_file)
procedure = __import__(procedure_name)

if procedure.validate(input_data):
output_data = procedure.run(input_data)
procedure.report(output_data)
```

The `input_data` should be a `__dict__` that was converted from the YAML file.

The `output_data` could be a `__dict__` or maybe JSON that could be parsed as part of a report template system.

What would an input file look like?

```yaml
procedure: DesignSteelBeam
version: 1.0
code: AISC 13th Edition
beam:
```

I have been interested in Functional Programming lately. My language of choice is of course Python. How would Functional Programming look in Python?

Could the program be such that it takes one argument, say a filename as an input and then returns a result, say a report string?

```
result = f(filename)
```

Could we connect it with Pandoc to create a PDF?

```zsh
$ program(filename) > result.md
$ source venv/bin/activate && pandoc -f markdown+implicit_figures  --filter pandoc-fignos result.md -o result.pdf

## Living on a Boat {#id5863650222}

#5863650222

What if we lived on a boat instead of in a house or apartment (condo)? How much would it cost? Could we really do it? Would we have to sell our current house?

There would be two states of living on the boat:
- Living docked at a marina.
- Living sailing or anchored not at a marina.

When living at a marina, you would have access to restaurants, virtually unlimited fresh water, electricity, the Internet, health care,

These local marinas allow people to sleep overnight.

1. Blind Pass Marina, St. Pete Beach
1. Gulfport Municipal Marina, Gulfport
1. Harborage Marina, St. Petersburg
1. Longboat Key Marina, Longboat Key
1. Parrot Cove Marina, Bradenton
1. Pasadena Marina, St. Petersburg
1. Regatta Pointe Marina, Bradenton
1. Riviera Dunes Marina, Palmetto
1. St. Petersburg Municipal Marina, St. Pete
1. Twin Dolphin Marina, Bradenton

Suppose we lived in each for 365/10 = 36.5 days a year each?

## Requirements, Processes, and Deliverables {#id1615060222}

#1615060222

[#requirement](#requirement) [#process](#process) [#deliverable](#deliverable) [#project-management](#project-management)

One way to think about a project is to think of the project organization as a set of processes that transform inputs into outputs. For a project, the inputs are the requirements. You can broadly think of anything that limits or directs project activities as a "requirement."

Perhaps a requirement is anything that affects the production of a deliverable or creates the need for a new deliverable.

![The Project Organization](images/reqirements-processes-deliverables.png)

A written requirement can import other requirements. So adding the requirement that the design meet a written design criteria incorporates all the requirements in the design criteria document.


## Moving to New Zealand {#id5895710222}

#5895710222

I looked up the top 10 countries with the best standard of living, and all the top 10 except New Zealand are pretty much cold climate Northern European countries. New Zealand is also an island, so a little like Florida -- a peninsula. Here are some random thoughts about it:

1. I would not want to move before Tommy is out of high school. I wonder what colleges are in New Zealand?

1. We would have to do some research about how to get a work visa to go there.

1. What if we formulated a plan to buy a nice boat, learn to sail it safely, and then when the day comes in a few years, sail it to New Zealand and start a new life there?

1. Might consider seeking a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification to bolster my already pretty strong resume.

The other day during one of my downtimes ("time wasting time") I suddenly got the urge to Google a Boeing 747 manual.

The thing is a masterpiece. It's the best manual I've ever seen.

## Seneca the Younger on the Terrors of Death {#id5891590222}

#5891590222

Here is one on death that I like. It is from this letter the translator called, ["On the Terrors of Death"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_4).

> 1. Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace with itself. Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the time when you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when one's mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.

He seems to be advising the reader to continue his philosophical pursuits. This jives pretty well with my "Lifelong Learner" identity I am cultivating by doing things like reading the letters of Seneca the Younger.

> 2. You remember, of course, what joy you felt when you laid aside the garments of boyhood and donned the man's toga, and were escorted to the forum; nevertheless, you may look for a still greater joy when you have laid aside the mind of boyhood and when wisdom has enrolled you among men. For it is not boyhood that still stays with us, but something worse, – boyishness. And this condition is all the more serious because we possess the authority of old age, together with the follies of boyhood, yea, even the follies of infancy. Boys fear trifles, children fear shadows, we fear both.

I like the part here where old men -- still boyish -- yet have authority. Old men fear little things and shadows. The little things are little, and the shadows are nothing.

> 3. All you need to do is to advance; you will thus understand that some things are less to be dreaded, precisely because they inspire us with great fear.

I'm not sure what he is getting at here. The first clause seems to be about the reader continuing to grow in wisdom by his pursuit of philosophy. That things are less to be dreaded because they inspire us with fear is interesting, but I have not worked out how I would paraphrase it.

> No evil is great which is the last evil of all. Death arrives; it would be a thing to dread, if it could remain with you. But death must either not come at all, or else must come and pass away.

The "last evil of all" must be the cause of your death. Not dreading it because it is fleeting is brilliant and poetical.

> 4. "It is difficult, however," you say, "to bring the mind to a point where it can scorn life." But do you not see what trifling reasons impel men to scorn life? One hangs himself before the door of his mistress; another hurls himself from the house-top that he may no longer be compelled to bear the taunts of a bad-tempered master; a third, to be saved from arrest after running away, drives a sword into his vitals. Do you not suppose that virtue will be as efficacious as excessive fear?

Many are those who want to die for trivial things. Likewise you can be ready for your own death. It is inevitable anyway. Might as well not fear death while life is still around.

> No man can have a peaceful life who thinks too much about lengthening it, or believes that living through many consulships is a great blessing.

This is quite Buddhist sounding. He's saying that those who cling to life cannot truly enjoy it. It also reminds me of Jesus saying, "He that loves his life shall lose it; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal" (John 12:25). I don't think this was Buddhist teaching by the author of John. It's more a carrot and a stick: if you are rich enough to enjoy your life, God will punish you in the afterlife, but if you are suffering in this life, God will make it right in the end. No wonder Christianity caught on at a time when life was worse than shitty.

> 5. Rehearse this thought every day, that you may be able to depart from life contentedly; for many men clutch and cling to life, even as those who are carried down a rushing stream clutch and cling to briars and sharp rocks. Most men ebb and flow in wretchedness between the fear of death and the hardships of life; they are unwilling to live, and yet they do not know how to die.

Very Buddhist here and wise. This bit was what led me to do this little primitive commentary.

> 6. For this reason, make life as a whole agreeable to yourself by banishing all worry about it. No good thing renders its possessor happy, unless his mind is reconciled to the possibility of loss; nothing, however, is lost with less discomfort than that which, when lost, cannot be missed. Therefore, encourage and toughen your spirit against the mishaps that afflict even the most powerful.

See [2020-08-26 The Most Important Lesson].

> 7. For example, the fate of Pompey was settled by a boy and a eunuch, that of Crassus by a cruel and insolent Parthian. Gaius Caesar ordered Lepidus to bare his neck for the axe of the tribune Dexter; and he himself offered his own throat to Chaerea. No man has ever been so far advanced by Fortune that she did not threaten him as greatly as she had previously indulged him. Do not trust her seeming calm; in a moment the sea is moved to its depths. The very day the ships have made a brave show in the games, they are engulfed.

So very true how "fate" can change in an instant.

> 8. Reflect that a highwayman or an enemy may cut your throat; and, though he is not your master, every slave wields the power of life and death over you. Therefore I declare to you: he is lord of your life that scorns his own. Think of those who have perished through plots in their own homes, slain either openly or by guile; you will then understand that just as many have been killed by angry slaves as by angry kings. What matter, therefore, how powerful he be whom you fear, when every one possesses the power which inspires your fear?

"He is lord of your life that scorns is own" is an important lesson. The person who scorns his life is not afraid to lose it. He is not desperate, he is jaded. He is dangerous. Thinking about the world right now, there are people out there with terribly bad lives who would cause harm to others because they hate the world. To Seneca's wisdom I would add my own: try to take pity on the man who scorns his life, for he is miserable.

> 9. "But," you will say, "if you should chance to fall into the hands of the enemy, the conqueror will command that you be led away," – yes, whither you are already being led. Why do you voluntarily deceive yourself and require to be told now for the first time what fate it is that you have long been labouring under? Take my word for it: since the day you were born you are being led thither. We must ponder this thought, and thoughts of the like nature, if we desire to be calm as we await that last hour, the fear of which makes all previous hours uneasy.

Do not fear being led away to be put to death, for your life is already leading you to death since the day you were born. Do not lie to yourself: you are going to die. Better to reflect on this idea with an open mind if you want to be calm during your last moments. Otherwise, all the hours preceding this will be frought.

> 10. But I must end my letter. Let me share with you the saying which pleased me to-day. It, too, is culled from another man's Garden: "Poverty brought into conformity with the law of nature, is great wealth." Do you know what limits that law of nature ordains for us? Merely to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. In order to banish hunger and thirst, it is not necessary for you to pay court at the doors of the purse-proud, or to submit to the stern frown, or to the kindness that humiliates; nor is it necessary for you to scour the seas, or go campaigning; nature's needs are easily provided and ready to hand.

Most of what we do is unnecessary. What is necessary is to avert hunger, thirst, and cold. Food, water, shelter, and maybe a few basics he skipped over are all we need. The rest is due to discontent. This may be a Stoic philosophy.

> 11. It is the superfluous things for which men sweat, – the superfluous things that wear our togas threadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign shores. That which is enough is ready to our hands. He who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich. Farewell.

It might be in another Seneca letter, but I recently heard the idea that you need money for the necessities of life and to buy "that which is enough." For if it is enough, you are at peace -- like the Buddha.

## Attic Rats {#id5867640222}

#5867640222

We sometimes get roof rats living in our attic or on our porch. A few days ago we heard them on the metal roof over the porch, so we put out some traps. The first day with the traps they took the bait but did not get caught. The second day we got one. Not sure if there were more than one, I re-baited the trap.

The next day in the early evening when it was pretty dark, we heard the trap go off. Julie held her iPhone light so I could see while we investigated. There was a rat in the trap with the trap pinching its waist. I was about to go get a bag to throw away the corpse when Julie exclaimed, "I think it's still alive!" Sure enough, the damn thing was breathing.

I felt pity on the creature and decided to dispatch its life to put it out of its misery. I grabbed a log from our log pile and bashed in its head unceramoniously. To my horror, the thing was still apparently alive after that blow. It's hard to know if it was conscious, but it was still moving significantly. I then resolved to make sure the job got done right and bashed it over and over again. Julie was squeemish - and I was too. The rat even gave out a squeek on about the 2nd blow which added to our feelings of guilt.

I feel okay knowing that I did in good faith try to put it out of its misery and did so as quickly as I could do - I was just incompetent the first time. Next time I will make it a quick and certain death.

## Cryptocurrency {#id1314060222}

#1314060222

[#crypto-currency](#crypto-currency)

I watched a [video by 3Blue1Brown on cryptocurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDN52m7Y21ePrTbvXkPaWVSg&index=6).

You can record your transactions with friends using a **ledger**. The ledger system protocol is:

1. Anyone can add lines to the ledger.

2. At the end of the month you settle up with real money.

This system has a serious flaw: item 1 opens the door for someone to cheat the system. What keeps Bob from adding a fictitious line saying that he paid Alice $100? Nothing. It requires perfect trust.

How can we resolve the trust issue? We can impose the requirement that the person who is paying has to add their _signature_ to the line in the ledger where they are paying.

This is all well and good, but we need a way to do this digitally. The way it is done is that each person using the ledger create a **private key

and **public key

pair. The private key is sometimes also called a **secret key

so that it can be abbreviated as "SK" while "PK" is used for _public_ key.

A digital signature is better than a real-world signatrue, becuase the digital signature is unique to each message. Your hand signature looks pretty much the same each time.

`Sign(Message, SK) = Signature`

For you to trust the system, it needs to be such that there is no way to verify the message is authrorized if you do not know the secret (or private) key.

`Verify(Message, Signature, PK) = True or False`

How do we make sure they cannot be guessed easily? We use 256 bit security. This gives us $2^{256}$ key combinations. The ledger system also requires that each line have a unique `Message + SK` signature. That way nobody can simply duplicate lines with valid signatures.

OK, this is great so far. But we still have a problem. How do we know that someone will pay the amount of _real_ cash at the end of each month? How do we trust the settlement process? How about this: each person ponies up a "real" cash amount at the beginning of the ledger. They can add or deduct from their balance as long as it remains above zero. No overspending is allowed. For this to work, we need to know the entire history of transactions at any given time so we can determine if the next proposed transaction is valid -- does the person have the money in their account?

We could have an entire economy using the ledger now. For convenience, let's call the "fake" money in the ledger as **ledger dollars

and abbreviate them LD.

The key insight here is of course this:

> Bitcoin is a trustwrothy digital ledger.

We still have a serious problem, I'm afraid. No individual can trust that they are keeping the same ledger as everyone else in the marketplace. It is this problem that the original Bitcoin paper solved elegantly and which made cryptocurrencies viable.

The cool idea of the paper is that there is computational work. The ledger is encrypted using a SHA-256 which is bascially a 256-bit representation of a message. The `SHAF256()` function is a one-way function. It's possible to go from the message to the resulting hash, but not the other direction. And it's impossible to predict the output of the `SHA256()` function. What the paper did was this: find a number which produces a hash that starts with 30 straight zeroes. There are $2^30 \approx 1$ billion ways to combine those 30 digits. Only one of them is all zeroes. So a random number will only produce the 30 zeroes 1 time out of a billion. Since `SHA256()` is unpredictable, we must brute-force go through these billion numbers until we find one that correctly produces a hash starting with 30 zeroes. The special number is called the **proof of work

because it takes computing power to find.

A **block

is a set of transaction with the _proof of work_ number appended. It must also have the previous block's hash _prepended_. Changing any block or re-ordering them will break the chain. For example, if you swap the order of two blocks, you change the prepended hash which causes the block's hash to be totally different. Then you have to find a new _proof of work_ to get back to 30 zeroes.

## Thoughts on Joe the Developer {#id5893960222}

#5893960222

I do not seem to stay motivated when there is not an obvious problem to solve in front of me. Back when I created the Legner Engineering Intranet site and BEARS, I was trying to solve very specific problems: how to manage a business and how to get work done efficiently and accurately so I could make money. Now I work for the power company. I don't have to worry about the business as much. And I don't really design anything. So I've been toying around with ideas like a dueling pianos app. But that one kind of died on the vine - first because I set it aside to finish my Master's degree and then because COVID-19 made it seem not as value-added with little to no dueling shows occurring.

## Nim Programming Language {#id5871800222}

#5871800222

I heard about a programming language called Nim that resembles Python but compiles to C, so it should run much faster I would think. To test this theory, I wrote the following two programs to flip a coin 1,000,000 times and report how many heads and tails were flipped.

Python version:
```python
import random

random.seed()

heads, tails = 0, 0

for i in range(0, 1000000):
if random.randint(0, 1) == 1:
heads = heads + 1
else:
tails += 1

print(f"{heads} heads and {tails} tails")
```

Nim version:
```nim
import random

var heads, tails: int = 0

randomize()

for i in countup(1, 1000000):
if rand(1) == 1:
heads = heads + 1
else:
inc(tails)

echo heads, " heads and ", tails, " tails."
```

Then I ran them and wouldn't you know it, the Nim version was much faster.

```zsh
joelegner:nim-playground/ $ time python3 flip.py                                                                                                                                           [12:50:19]
499004 heads and 500996 tails
python3 flip.py  1.12s user 0.01s system 98% cpu 1.150 total
joelegner:nim-playground/ $ time ./flip                                                                                                                                                     [8:48:39]
499336 heads and 500664 tails.
./flip  0.07s user 0.00s system 94% cpu 0.074 total
```

Python took 1.15 seconds, while Nim only took 0.074 seconds. So Python took 15 times as long to do the work.

## Thomas Jefferson on Newspapers {#id5892840222}

#5892840222

I found this letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Norvell almost painfully apropos for today. It harmonizes with my worldview.

Source: <https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/print_documents/amendI_speechs29.html>

> To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted, so as to be most useful, I should answer, "by restraining it to true facts & sound principles only." Yet I fear such a paper would find few subscribers. It is a melancholy truth, that a suppression of the press could not more compleatly deprive the nation of it's benefits, than is done by it's abandoned prostitution to falsehood. Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. The real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knolege with the lies of the day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live & die in the belief, that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time; whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables. General facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great [Volume 5, Page 170] portion of Europe to his will, &c., &c.; but no details can be relied on. I will add, that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods & errors. He who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false.

> Perhaps an editor might begin a reformation in some such way as this. Divide his paper into 4 chapters, heading the 1st, Truths. 2d, Probabilities. 3d, Possibilities. 4th, Lies. The first chapter would be very short, as it would contain little more than authentic papers, and information from such sources as the editor would be willing to risk his own reputation for their truth. The 2d would contain what, from a mature consideration of all circumstances, his judgment should conclude to be probably true. This, however, should rather contain too little than too much. The 3d & 4th should be professedly for those readers who would rather have lies for their money than the blank paper they would occupy.

## Ramblings {#id5862720222}

#5862720222

Regret is the pain you feel from a decision resulting in an unwanted outcome. You expected the decision to go the other way. It could be eliminated entirely if you could instill in yourself the belief that you are using good decision-making processes and uncertainty is just part of life. Buddhism would say something along the lines that your expectation led to the pain. If you eliminate the expectation, you eliminate the pain.

Being afraid to do or say something is what your planning mind expects you to feel if you do it or say it. The feeling of fear is not quite the same as pain, but it is definitely a negative emotion. You would rather not be afraid. Fear points away from action. It points to inaction or alternate action.

If you are afraid to walk on thin ice, you are imagining yourself suffering in the cold water.

What would it be like to have zero fear? Let's start there and work backwords. With zero fear, you would only be motivated by desire for something like food. I guess

Expectation is the delusion that everything is going to work out the way you want it or better. Aspiration is the reality. You might not get what you want. Aspiration is imporant, because it gets us to strive for things. It motivates us. We are motivated to aspire to a number of simultaneous outcomes, some of which are logically contradictory. But all this insanity ends up in quite a steady state, steady enough for the body carrying it to survive in a very complicated and messed-up, human-filled world for many decades. The only thing that gives out now, growing old, may also fall victim to the march of man's knowledge. Maybe someday our ancestors will know how to live longer, even very long. It would be no contradiction for our ancestors to breed themselves to get happier and happier over the centuries, but I do not believe it will happen.

We should do everything in our power to spread ideas that increase happiness. Any idea that increases happiness without reducing the happiness of another is a step in the right direction. We take baby steps. We see if this direction looks promising, and we go there and then take stock of everyone's happyiness level. If it moved up, we are content. The amount of joy that the happyiness generates should be integrated over time for all people. The idea you want people to have is that they should make other people happy as often as possible, which is to say they should be kind and benevolent. If this got going and really spread, it would change the world. Kindness should have a feedback loop with happiness, too, because it feels good to be kind. It also feels good to get back at someone. The first motive is better, because it makes two people happy. The second motive only makes you happy. I guess maybe a friend would be happy for you, but that chain is going to go off to infinity. We should stick with worrying about the primary beneficiary or victim of the act.

## Impermanence {#id5878470222}

#5878470222

I had a sense of impermanence today. I was sitting at my computer around 7:45 in the evening, yawning like crazy. It felt good, because I had worked out this morning, and it felt like my body was actually tired for once. I will probably sleep well. What occurred to me was that yesterday I was a ball of energy in the evening, reading voraciously and frantically adding Anki cards to capture the knowledge. I read some things about Buddhism.  I read a book about probability. It's funny how impermanent a good day or a high-energy feeling is. Nothing lasts. Chuckling about it seems more appropriate than despairing that every day cannot be a good day.

## Python Project {#id5884690222}

#5884690222

I so wish I had a project to develop in Python. I tried that decision making app but ran out of motivation for it.

## Writing {#id5884740222}

#5884740222

I like writing. I feel like I'm getting better at it. My sentences now have a flow to them that they did not seem to have before. I was always a pretty good academic writer, but what else can I write? I could try fiction. I've always threatened to. But I have these high aspirations for my first work that I don't think I can deliver. I want it to be at once a philosophical work and a moving literary masterpiece. Maybe instead I should just write _something_ and see where it goes from there.

## Engineering Units Project {#id0414060222}

#0414060222

[#python](#python) [#engineering](#engineering) [#units](#units)

I've got a vague idea to make a Python project that will handle engineering units: feet, inches, kips, pounds, kip-feet, meters, newtons, newton-meters, and so on. What do I want it to look like? Let's brainstorm the usage and see if it seems fun.

```python
>>> from units import inches, feet, psf, kips
>>> L = 10.0*feet
>>> L
10.0 ft
>>> B = 8*feet
>>> B
8.0 ft
>>> B*L
80.0 ft^2
>>> q = 100.0*psf
>>> q
100.0 psf
>>> P = q*B*L
>>> P
8000.0 lb
>>> P.convert(kips) # Changes P
>>> P
8.0 kips
>>> P.in_units(pounds) # Does not change P
8000.0 lb
>>> P
8.0 kips
```

## Toshiba External Hard Drive Backup {#id5876930222}

#5876930222

Now that I am using my Mac almost exclusively, I had to come up with a way to back up my Google Drive to my Toshiba external hard drive. I re-wrote my `backup-toshiba.sh` script, but it was not working. It turns out that NTFS disks are read-only for MacOS. So I had to reformat it as `exFAT` based on what I read here:
<https://www.trickyways.com/2019/12/format-external-hard-drive-to-use-mac-and-pc/>

My backup script is now just a one-liner:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

## Kayak Trip Checklist {#id5878730222}

#5878730222

I created a new Kayak Trip Checklist under Google Drive / Tools / Checklists.

## Checklist App Idea {#id5873400222}

#5873400222

I have an idea for a checklist application. First let me give you an idea of the kind of checklist I mean.

![Example Checklist Format](images/checklist-example.png)

The structure seems to include the following.

1. A title.
1. A set of hold points: Before Engine Start, Engine Start (normal), Engine Start (flooded), ..., Shutdown.
1. A list for each hold point. Each list line item consists of:
A. An integer number 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
B. A noun which represents either:
1. A physical object: seats, flaps, parking break
1. A control selector: flap switch, oil pressure
1. An instrument: airspeed, suction gage.
C. The desired state of object represented by said noun: on, off, up, set, 1000 RPM, 100 MPH.

Each **checklist

contains:

- Property: Title
- Property: Author Name
- Property: Latest Date / Time
- Children: Set of $n$ hold points.

Each **hold point

contains:

- Property: hold point name
- Children: Set of $m$ line items.

Each **checklist item

(line item) contains:

- Property: Sequence number (integer)
- Property: Object (noun)
- Property: Desired state (adverb or adjective)

We will also need a way to record what happened when we used the checklist. We will call this a checklist encounter.

Each **checklist encounter

contains:

- Property: Datetime of encounter start.
- Property: Datetime of encounter end.
- Children: Set of $p$ checklist item result objects.

Each **checklist line item result

contains:

- Property: Pointer to checklist item.
- Property: Completed boolean
- Property: Datetime the box was checked.

## Backyard Table {#id5899770222}

#5899770222

We had an old table that was made for indoors, and we had it on the porch. The table top was some kind of pressed wood crap which started getting moldy. So I discarded the old top and made plans to install a new table top. At first I thought it should be a round top, but we settled on square because it is easier to build and gives a little more surface area.

## Duolingo {#id5862790222}

#5862790222

Today is Sunday. I am starting the lessons **Shopping 5

and **Health 2

on Duolingo. Duolingo shows that I have learned 2932 words in Spanish. Recall that my goal is 10,000 words to be fluent. I started on May 21, 2019 which means I have been learning Spanish for 1 year, 6 months, and 8 days which is 558 days not including today.

Let's do a simple extrapolation to get to the day when I will know 10,000 words:

$$D_{10,000} = \dfrac{10,000}{2932}558 = 1,903\text{ days}$$

The remaining days to get to 10,000 then would be 1,903 - 558 = 1,345 days which puts estimated completion at August 5, 2024.

## Sobriety Day 3 {#id5867440222}

#5867440222

We are still going strong on our quest not to drink alcohol anymore. Julie is really down right now. She is not talking much, either, which worries me. She decided to watch the last season of [_The Handmaid's Tale_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)), because she had started it, and it just became available to watch inexpensively. But the story itself is depressing, and she keeps seeing ads in between that are depressing -- reminders of COVID-19 and how sucky the world is right now. I would rather she do something wholesome like play music online, but we shall see. Hopefully she will regain her energy later this afternoon and play music.

## Ontologies {#id5880480222}

#5880480222

Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_components>

An ontology is a system of definitions and interrelations that describe a "domain of discourse."

> ...an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.

Almost universal components of ontologies:

- **Individuals**: The basic, ground level objects.

- **Classes**: Sets, collections, concepts, types of objects, or kinds of things

- **Attributes**: Aspects, properties, features, characteristics, or parameters that objects and classes can have.

- **Relations**: Ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another.

Less common components include:

- **Function terms**: Complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement

- **Restrictions**: Formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input

- **Rules**: Statements in the form of an if-then (antecedent-consequent) sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form

- **Axioms**: Assertions (including rules) in a logical form that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application. This definition differs from that of "axioms" in generative grammar and formal logic. In those disciplines, axioms include only statements asserted as a priori knowledge. As used here, "axioms" also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements

- **Events**: The changing of attributes or relations

## Django Installation {#id5875570222}

Today I installed Django using [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django). Here were my settings:

After that I installed PostgreSQL 12 using the command:

```bash
$ brew install postgresql@12
```

I used version 12 because Cookiecutter Django does not prompt for version 13.

I also had to add this to `.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@12/bin:$PATH"
```

This gave me some weird error, so I uninstalled it and instead installed `Postgres.app` from this website: <https://postgresapp.com/>. This seemed to work.

## Systems Thinking {#id5883440222}

#5883440222

A system is an entity made up of interrelated, interdependent parts that acts in a purposive way. It exists in an environment with other system. Its top-level parts are subsystems. Each subsystem is a complete system in its own right. The subsystem's environment is the parent system.

Each person in the organization is not part of the organization's system. It is not even an input, but its service is. It's more like a tool. A person is its own complete (and very complex I might add) system. It is a service provider. Services include sensing things, thinking, and physical labor. We should treat each employee like a contractor: define the work to be done and the minimum expectations. They _how_ is more flexible. The individual can contribute ways to do things, improvise, etc.

A job description should have the same parts as a Construction Scope of Work.

The OPM department is providing information to its environment. It takes labor, money, raw materials, and information as inputs and outputs information, constructed materials, and money.

The labor is the engine that converts the information into money. Or by thinking instead, the labor force uses the money to get contractors to provide some of the information we are selling. Labor is the energy input. Money is a store of labor, so it is a store of energy input. It is a battery. We can take batteries from outside systems in exchange for something of value: raw materials, information, or even more money, uh, batteries if it is invested.

Each of us individual workers is our own system, and like the company, we need to profit to get along. We provide our labor (body) and thinking (mind) in exchange for money. The money is a store of labor we can now save, invest, or deploy. So if we need a gallon of gas, we exchange some of the money we earned for the labor and thought it took to extract, refine, ship, and dispense gasoline.

A person can provide either information processing (brain power) or physical labor (body power). Each one costs the person precious time and energy. The brain does for the company what it does best: it processes information, solves problems, communicates, decides,

## Types of Waste in Service Industry {#id5884860222}

#5884860222

1. Delay on the part of customers waiting for service, for delivery, in queues for response, not arriving as promised.

1. Duplication. Having to re-enter data, repeat details on forms, copy
information across, answer queries from several sources within the same
organisation.

1. Unnecessary Movement. Queuing several times, lack of one-stop, poor
ergonomics in the service encounter.

1. Unclear communication, and the wastes of seeking clarification, confusion
over product or service use, wasting time finding a location that may result
in misuse or duplication.

1. Incorrect inventory. Being out-of-stock, unable to get exactly what was required, substitute products or services.

1. An opportunity lost to retain or win customers, a failure to establish
rapport, ignoring customers, unfriendliness, and rudeness.

1. Errors in the service transaction, product defects in the product-service
bundle, lost or damaged goods.

1. Service quality errors, lack of quality in service processes.

## Task in an Ontology {#id3813060222}

#3813060222

[#ontology](#ontology) [#semantics](#semantics)

In thinking about an ontology, what is a task?

- A period of time during which you are performing goal-oriented work.
- A string of words on one line of a task list.
- A recurring job to do.

For my ontology I am thinking something like this:

Task
: The idea of doing work to accomplish a goal.

Project
: A planned process composed using a sequence of tasks.

Backlog
: The list of outstanding tasks at any given time.

Project List
: A database of projects.

Project List Implementation
: The physical way the project list is recorded in the real world. It could be a whteboard, a paper list, a spreadsheet, or a SharePoint library.

## My Business {#id5895460222}

#5895460222

I just learned that the word business essentially means any activity that you do to make a profit. So I guess my "business" includes working at TECO and investing. Formerly I could have included playing band gigs.

Today I worked for about a half day, reporting to Big Bend because of an outage. The outage ended last night, so it turned out I did not really need to be there. But I worked anyway.

Julie made some non-alcoholic mimosas. They are really pretty good. I sat in the living room and listened to Tommy for maybe 30 minutes before about 9:00 pm. Joey was on his computer all night like usual. He does not tend to interact unless he wants something.

## OKRs for 2021 {#id5895660222}

#5895660222

I suddenly decided to try out OKRs for the first time. I will be replacing my Habitica habit with OKRs. So I created a Google Sheets document to track the OKRs and here we go.

## Deliberative Problem Solving Method {#id0514060222}

#0514060222

[#problem-solving](#problem-solving) [#critical-thinking](#critical-thinking)

1. State, or "frame," the problem to be solved;
2. Identify and prioritize the relevant values, interests, and objectives;
3. Identify and resolve major uncertainties concerning the cause of the problem;
4. Generate a range of plausible solutions or alternative courses of action;
5. Predict the consequences of the courses of action and assess their impact on the relevant interests or objectives;
6. Select the course of action that optimizes the interests or objectives to be served (i.e., make a decision);
7. Implement, observe, and learn from the outcome of the decision.

## Building an Ontology using Protege {#id5891340222}

#5891340222

1. Add classes. Accept disjoint relationship default.
1. Remove unnecessary disjoint relationships.
1. Add object properties. Accept default: _not_ disjoint.
1. Give each object property a type: functional, inverse functional, symmetric, asymmetric, transitive, reflexive, and irreflexive.
1. Add individuals under the Individuals task.
1. Assign a Type to each individual.

## Finance Course {#id5869900222}

#5869900222

Today I started a Udemy course on personal finance. I will put the information I learn in Anki cards to remember.

## Improving OPM {#id5877550222}

#5877550222

_What is the current situation that we intend to impact?_

The reputation for performance of OPM needs to be strengthened.

_What will it look like when we achieve the desired situation or outcome?_

Upper management will approve of the performance of the department.

_What behaviors need to change for that outcome to be achieved?_

We have to satisfy the customers: the station's management, director, and upper management.

_What knowledge or skills do people need before the behavior will change?_


_What activities need to be performed to cause the necessary learning?_


_What resources will be required to achieve the desired outcome?_

## System Diagram for Creativity {#id3913060222}

#3913060222

[#system](#system) [#creativity](#creativity) [#diagram](#diagram)

This system diagram was proposed by Mihály Csikszentmihalyi in a book promoting a "systems approach" to creativity. But I can see other uses.

![System Diagram for Creativity](../diagrams/yed/individual-domain-field-system.png)

**Individual**
: A single person

**Discipline**
: A portion of reality studied by a field

**Field**
: The set of individuals practicing in the discipline

This is an interesting trio. Let's look at some examples from my life.

- Buddhism
- Individual = Bhikku
- Discipline = Dharma
- Field = Sangha
- Structural Engineering
- Individual = Joe Legner
- Discipline = Structural Engineering
- Field = Practicing Structural Engineers
- Medicine
- Individual = Doctor McLovin
- Discipline = Medicine
- Field = Medical Community
- My Job
- Individual = Joe Legner
- Discipline = Working at TECO
- Field = Employees

## Virtue Continuum {#id5878440222}

#5878440222

Julie sent this to me today, and I liked it.

![Virtue Continuum](images/virtue-continuum.jpg)

## Objectives and Decisions {#id5872600222}

#5872600222

Decisions are best understood as attempts by the decision maker to meet their objectives or goals. Assuming the decision maker wants their influence on the future to be _positive_ we might characterize their objectives as capturing their perceived idea of a better future.

Objectives represent desires that may be described by a verb and an object.

- `[Verb]` `[object]`
- Minimize effort
- Maximize safety
- Improve quality

The _set_ of objectives provides the _purpose_ for a decision, specifying what one hopes to achieve.

If this is all true, it follows that:

> Knowing one's objectives is essential to sound decision making.

### What ways were fruitful to get people to generate more objectives?

1. Providing decision makers with a category-based aid was of limited success.

1. Providing decision makers with a category-based aid to _supplement_ their original list resulted in improvement. The motivation to add more objectives or a second chance to think about objectives seems to be important.

1. Believing that additional effort (a second look) will be fruitful improved the ability to generate objectives. Informing people that research indicates most individuals can add more objectives resulted in substatial improvements.

1. Giving a target number of objectives was helpful. One way to do this is to make the simple request to list objectives, double the number they generated, and inform them that the new target is this doubled value, probably without telling them why you arrived at this number.


### What ways were not?

1. Providing sample objectives. The cause might be that exposure to certain items in a target set may inhibit recall of other items.# 2021-01-27 Estimating Probability of a Good Outcome

You have inputs, a decision-making process, the decision -- which is the output of the decision-making process, and the results, or outcome. Here are the steps you take. This is normally done informally.

1. Collect the facts. These are the inputs to the procedure.
2. Analyze the facts to make a decision. You use a procedure for this.
3. Observe the outcome of the decision.

How likely is it that what I believe to be true is really true? How good is my information?

How likely is it that I used the right decision-making process?

How likely is it that I used the decision-making process right?

When I design a steel beam. Where are the possible sources of problems? The steel could be bad. The wrong shape could be used by the fabricator. The bolts might be defective. The loads might be higher than anticipated. There might be a calculation error. There might be an error in the code.

We could take the inverse of these and multiply the lot of them, as long as they are independent. It would seem like a waste of time to bother estimating things with such a remote probability that it will not materially affect the coverall **conjunctive

event. The probability does not change much when you multiply it by a microprobability: (1 - 1/1000000) = 0.999999.

What about "ordinary" risks like equipment failures and design success? Here we are definitly within the realm of something out of 100 chance being acceptable. In honor of microprobability, suppose we call this a "centiprobability." It's truly a _percent_ chance.

We don't want equipment to fail regularly. So on an hourly basis, we might be in the microprobability order of magnitude. But the failure rate over, say, 10 years might be well into the centiprobability order of magnitude. We might say OK to a 45% chance in 10 years.

## My Standards For Myself {#id5891690222}

#5891690222

I want to weigh 165 +/- 5 pounds. I feel healthier, sexier, and more accomplished if I put on a little muscle. It's worth the effort.

I want to be a lifelong learner.

I want to be able to change my own mind about things.

I want to learn new things.

I want to be a kind person that respects people.

I do not want to be a wimp. I want to be ready to fight for something important to me.

I want the things that are important to me to be wholesome.# 2021-04-20

Tomorrow I am interviewing for the Manager of Engineering Support Services (MESS, ironically) for the Outages and Project Management Department (O&PM) of the Energy Supply business unit of Tampa Electric Company. I'm not sure why I wrote all that, but I guess deep down I hope someone who does not know me might read this. Maybe.

Anyway, one of the questions that they will ask at the end is basically, "Why do you think we should choose you?" It's meant to give them some time to finish their ratings. But I want to answer well. And here's the rub: I am not sure I want the job. It's a lot to take on.

I came here to write my thoughts about answering that question, but I think I should analyze the anxiety I am feeling tonight.

## Self-Care Behaviors {#id4013060222}

#4013060222

[#self-care](#self-care) [#journal](#journal) [#journaling](#journaling)

I haven't felt a strong pull to write a journal entry lately. But ironically, when I had to do those surveys (that I never told you about until just now) every night, it was enjoyable to do. I really think I could create my own set of a few and take them every day to do some experimenting. I could model the behavior I want (right view or something) and add a measurement. It can be something real, like the number of times that day that I did $X$. Or it can be more abstract, like my subjective self-confidence rating.

If you could do this and also record everything you _do_ in a day, you could start to find correlations. Maybe whenever you talk to a friend, you are happy for two days thereafter. Then you can say, "Hey, I should go play music with Nichole. It's wholesome. It will help me, and it will help her."

OK, so let's think what a good behavior might be. It seems like it should be something social. My self-care behaviors are pretty good right now. Let's start with some communications ideas. How about these?

- Text a friend.
- Text a parent.
- See a friend in person.
- Coach someone.
- Encourage someone.
- Complement someone.
- Give positive feedback about someone.
- Talk up the vision.
- Write something.
- Read something.
- Meditate.

## Department System {#id5878370222}

#5878370222

I feel like the department is the people only. The department _has_ a budget. The department _has_ facilities it uses. But the department is not these things. It is the people only. They are the only actors. They are purposeful elements of the system. If I ever want to diagram the department system, it would simply be the people. In fact, I could use the organization chart. The relationship in the hierarchy would be something like, "reports to" and "directs" in the other direction.

![Org Chart Network Diagram](diagrams/graphviz/org-chart-network-diagram.png)

## KB {#id5889580222}

#5889580222

For years I've had this "KB" project which is essentially a set of PDFs. What if I made this into a formal ontology? Individuals would include the PDFs, and any other medium of knowledge capture and retrieval, such as physical books, audio recordings, and videos.

## Buddhist Path {#id5873710222}

#5873710222

This idea would be to create an ontology to model the concepts of the Buddhist path. This would include terms like Buddha, dharma, Noble Eightfold Path, Four Noble Truths, and so on.


## Music {#id5866920222}

#5866920222

This ontology idea is to capture my musical life: bands, gigs, performances, instruments, practice, etc. It would answer the question, "How can I best actualize my musician identity?"

## My Life {#id5887580222}

#5887580222

This would be much more ambitious than the ideas above. This ontology would answer big questions like:

1. What is the best way to spend my time?
1. How much exercise do I need?
1. What should I eat and drink?
1. What are my values?
1. How do I best pursue my values?
1. What actions are wholesome?
1. Are habits better than goals and OKRs?
1. How do I build habits?
1. How do I achieve enlightenment?

It could even be the culimination of several smaller ontologies rolled into one. How about something like:

- My Musical Life
- My Inner Life
- My Personal Life
- My Spiritual Life
- My Work Life
- My Social Life

Or it could be self-actualization type ontologies, each one named after an identiy I want to cultivate.

- Social Person
- Husband
- Friend
- Engineer
- Musician
- Lifelong Learner
- Teacher

Here are some terms and ideas.

- A person spends time on an activity.
- An activity is when we employ our body and mind to do something.
- A person has things they value in life.
- An objective is a short-term state of affairs derived from values and circumstances.
- Wellness includes physical health and mental health.
- Wholesome is an adjective meaning "conducive to or indicative of good health or well-being."
- A habit is an activity you regularly engage in without having to summon up motivation.

Wholesome activities is the set of activities conducive to desired states of physical health, mental health, social status,


## The Eight Worldly Conditions {#id5890380222}

#5890380222

1. Gain
1. Loss
1. Praise
1. Blame
1. Good Reputation
1. Bad Reputation
1. Pleasure
1. Pain

We can use these to help us define wholesome and unwholesome activities.

- A wholesome activity leads away from loss, blame, bad reputation, and pain.
- A wholesome activity leads toward gain, praise, good reputation, and pleasure.
- An un wholesome activity leads toward from loss, blame, bad reputation, and - pain.
- An unwholesome activity leads away from gain, praise, good reputation, and pleasure.

The law of karma is what connects wholesome actions to positive outsomes.

- Being - Existing without doing or training.
- Training - Getting better at doing something.
- Doing - Performing what we have trained to do.
- Reflecting - Thinking about all the above.

## JoeKB Ontology {#id5882960222}

#5882960222

I am going to make my ontology the JoeKB Ontology. It think it will be a good starting point.

### Domain and Scope

The domain for this ontology includes the following portions of the world:
- Things owned by Joe Legner.
- Things that are computer files of books or book-like works.
- Things that are physical books.

The scope should include the content, categorization, tagging, search, and retrieval of said things, including the physical books. Retrieval of the physical books will require some kind of notions of location in the real world. We might start with address, building, room, and location within room as a basic system.

It should be able to handle the same computer file in multiple locations.

It sould be able to handle:
- Multiple copies of the same computer file.
- Multiple copies of the same work in physical book format and computer file format.

It will probably need to be populated programatically somehow, by looking at Metadata in PDF files or looking up book metadata online using ISBN or something.

### Competency Questions

1. What PDF files do I have related to engineering?
1. What PDF files do I have related to structural engineering?
1. What PDF files do I have related to structural steel engineering?
1. Where should new information go?

## SQLite and Python {#id5861870222}

#5861870222

I have this vague idea that I should get really good at using SQLite and Python together. I have looked at things like SQLAlchemy, and other things like Django ORM, but none of them really do exactly what I want them to do. That gives me this harebrained idea of writing my own library. But I don't think I want to commit to something like that. But just for fun, what if I brainstorm what it might look like if it was being used and worked well?

It should be dead simple to connect to the database.

```python
>>> from xxx import Database
>>> db = Database("opm.sqlite3")
>>> db.tables()
["deliverable", "deliverable_process", "process", "process_deliverable"]
```

A record should be its own class of the same name, but capitalized.

```python
>>> for record in db["deliverable"]:
...     print(type(record))
Deliverable
```
We could do this with the database so it always closes.

```python
>>> with Database("opm.sqlite3") as db:
...      pass
```

The other class in many-to-many relations should be easy to access.

```python
>>> deliverable = db["deliverable"][0]   # Returns first record
>>> print(deliverable)
"Support Request"
>>> print(deliverable.processes)
(("Onboarding Process", 0),}
```

Note how the processes are returned as a tuple of tuples. This is because each many-to-many table (here `deliverable_process`) can add data. So we need more than just the other instance of Process. We need the data, too, and we can provide it in the tuple.

```python
with Database("opm.sqlite3") as db:
with db["deliverable"] as table:
for record in table:
print(record)
```

What would it look like in a Jinja2 scenario?

```python
db = Database("opm.sqlite3"),
context = {
"deliverables"  : db["deliverable"],
"processes"     : db["process"],
"roles"         : db["roles"],
}
```

{% for d in deliverables %}
# {{ d.name }}

{% if d.deliverable_process %}

- {{process.name}} {% if d.is_trigger(process) %}(trigger){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Deliverable {{d.name}} is output from these processes:

These roles are involved in the production of deliverable {{d.name}}:

{{role.name}} is {{role.role_deliverable.raci_name}} for {{d.name}}
{% endfor %}

## Fact {#id5869580222}

#5869580222

1. Incident, act, event, or circumstance. A fact is something that has already been done or an action in process. It is an event that has definitely and actually taken place, and is distinguishable from a suspicion, innuendo, or supposition. A fact is a truth as opposed to fiction or mistake. A Question of Fact in litigation is concerned with what actually took place. During a trial, questions of fact are generally left for the jury to determine after each opposing side has presented its case. By contrast, a Question of Law is ordinarily decided by a judge, who must deal with applicable legal rules and principles that affect what transpired.

1. An actual thing or happening, which must be proved at trial by presentation of evidence and which is evaluated by the finder of fact (a jury in a jury trial, or by the judge if he/she sits without a jury).

1. An event, occurrence or state of affairs known to have happened; to be distinguished from opinion or law. Facts can however be found proven in legal proceedings where they may or may not have actually happened. Facts may also be inferred from other facts.

1. Something that has actual existence : a matter of objective reality

1. Any of the circumstances of a case that exist or are alleged to exist in reality : a thing whose actual occurrence or existence is to be determined by the evidence presented at trial.

FACT. An action; a thing done. It is either simple or compound.

2. A fact is simple when it expresses a purely material act unconnected with any moral qualification; for example, to say Peter went into his house, is to express a simple fact. A compound fact contains the materiality of the act, and the qualification which that act has in its connexion with morals and, the law. To say, then, that Peter has stolen a horse, is to express a compound fact; for the fact of stealing, expresses at the same time, the material fact of taking the horse, and of taking him with the guilty intention of depriving the owner of his property and appropriating it to his own use; which is a violation of the law of property.

3. Fact. is also put in opposition to law; in every case which has to be tried there are facts to be established, and the law which bears on those facts.

4. Facts are also to be considered as material or immaterial. Material facts are those which are essential to the right of action or defence, and therefore of the substance of the one or the other - these must always be proved; or immaterial, which are those not essential to the cause of action these need not be proved. 3 Bouv. Inst. n. 3150-53.

5. Facts are generally determined by a jury,; but there are many facts, which, not being the principal matters in issue, may be decided by the court; such, for example, whether a subpoena has or has not been served; whether a party has or has not been summoned, &c. As to pleading material facts, see Gould. Pl. c. 3, s. 28. As to quality of facts proved, see 3 Bouv. Inst. n. 3150. Vide Eng. Ece. R. 401-2, and the article Circumstances.# 2021-06-30 Hard Rain

Today around 3:00 or 3:30 it rained, hard, at Big Bend Station. The ditches were all running. The parking lot was so flooded that the water went over top of my shoes as I got in my car to go home.

In related weather news, the hurricane season is just now starting to get going. There are some disturbances in the Cape Verde pattern that they are watching.

## Decision-Making Terms {#id0814060222}

#0814060222

[#decision-making](#decision-making) [#ontology](#ontology)

Here are a few terms and relations between terms to whet one's appetite for learning about decision-making. The first block quotes are taken from "An Overview of Decision Theory."

> **Decision theory

deals with **situations

in which one or more **actors

must make **choices

among given **alternatives**. These alternatives may be courses of action to be undertaken, objects to possess, amounts of money to pay for them, etc. They mayaiso be 'what to believe'. For instance, a jury deliberating on the guilt or innocence of a defendant must eventually choose collectively between 'believing that the defendant is guilty' and 'believing that he is innocent'.

> **Choice

and **freedom of choice

are primitive (not further analyzable) terms and the assumption that such freedom exists is fundamental in decision theory.

> Furthermore, decision theory is based on an assumption that each choice (decision) entails consequences called **outcomes

and that each of the actors making the decisions has **preferences

for the different outcomes. It is not assumed that an actor necessarily has full **knowledge

of just what those consequences will be; but it is assumed that an actor envisages at least some of them, and it is these envisaged consequences that he prefers to varying degrees. The extent and the precision of an actor's knowledge (or presumed knowledge) of the consequences is specified in a particular model of a **decision situation**.

Consequences may involve **gains

or **losses**.

> In order to discuss a **decision situation

with the view of understanding it better, the situation must be circumscribed. Specification of what is to be assumed or taken into account amounts to formulating a **model**. Decision theory, like any other theory, considers **models of situations

rather than situations in all their complexities and ramifications.

> A **descriptive decision theory

purports to deal with questions pertaining to how people behave in given choice situations. It raises questions about what we need to know in order successfully to predict their behaviour in such situations. A **normative theory

poses questions of a different sort, namely, how people *ought to* behave in given decision situations; also how the individual preferences of the actors can be reconciled with their collective interests (if any).

> The branch of normative decision theory dealing with situations involving more than one actor constitutes the **theory of games**. the distinction between games involving exactly two actors, now called **players

(two-person games) and those involving more than two ($n$-person games) is an important one, because $n$-person games may involve the formation of **coalitions**.

> The possibility of forming coalitions is the essential feature of the **cooperative game**. Members of coalition **cooperate

in the sense that they coordinate their strategies while they pursue a **common goal**. This cooperation makes sense only ifthe members of a coalition have a **common goal**. This is the case if they are able to achieve more by coordinating their choices than by playing independently. It is assumed in the theory of the cooperative game that the **coordination of choices

is achieved by effecting **agreements

and that these agreements are **enforceable**. The competitive aspect of an n-person cooperative game ($n > 2$) is manifested in the opposition between the interests of one coalition and those of other coalitions. At times, all of the $n$ players may form the **grand coalition**.

> The bargaining power of a player can be manifested in two ways: (1) by his **threat leverage

and (2) by his **value

to the particular coalitions he can join.

Thus a player can either be a threat or an ally. Doesn't this ring true in real life, especially work life with all its political machinations?

> The player can demand a larger share of \[the\] joint gain by threatemng to withdraw cooperation, that is, to ehoose some alternative other than that preseribed to hirn, resulting in a loss to others (as weIl as, generally, to hirnself). The relative threat leverage of the players is measured by the **losses entailed**. Games in whieh the threat leverages of the players are of central interest are called **bargaining games**.

> The **value

of a player to a **coalition

is reflected in the extent to which he can by joining it **increase the payoff

the coalition can expect to get if it has to play against the remaining players, also in coalition. In particular, in making a claim for a share of the joint payoff of the grand coalition, the player can bolster his claim by pointing out what he could gain if he (and perhaps some others) **broke away

from the grand coalition to form one of their own.

Leah came to Julie's gig tonight! It was a fun surprise to see her. I was sitting at a table with Tiffanie and her friends, and there was Leah coming around the corner. She ended up coming over to the house after the show and left super late like 3:15 am.

## Mindfulness Experiment {#id2814060222}

#2814060222

[#mindfulness](#mindfulness) [#meditation](#meditation)

One day on my way home, I did a spontaneous and unplanned mindfulness experiement. Recently, I have been listening to Joseph Goldstein talk about using passive voice for mental noting. That must have influenced me to perform this little mental experiment while I was driving.

Recently, I have been listening to Joseph Goldstein talk about using passive voice for mental noting. That must have influenced me to perform this little mental experiment while I was driving.

On the way home, I began mentally noting what was happening in a passive voice. They seem to have a calming influence on me. The last few days, I have felt a little unsettled about the world. I've had that kind of vague, "something is not right" feeling in my gut. Doing this thought experiment kind of made that fade for a while. Here are some examples of the phrases I said out loud quietly to myself:

- "Feeling acceleration, pressure increase."

- "Recognizing sign, words, license plate."

- "Recognizing red lights. Remembering brake lights. Thinking of risk."

- "Seeing mailbox and knowing of the seeing."

- "Pedal vibrating and knowing of vibrating."

- "Sloth and torpor."

- "Sensation; itching in eyebrow. Urge to scratch. Allowing scratching to occur. Scratching. Feeling of urge fading."

I went on and on. It was great fun, and my thoughts turned toward Julie and the kids. Maybe they can try it with me someday.

> Noticing "I" was used ten times here!

## Learning Cycle {#id5871670222}

#5871670222

Maybe I should think about how I learn. I'm talking about "book learning" here. What am I trying to do when I learn? Is it not the following?

1. Acquire idea about a known domain.

1. Acquire a new domain to explore.

1. Make a new connection between two concepts in an existing domain.

We can integrate this into my existing ontology knowledge. Remember that things naturally fall into:

1. Individuals

1. Classes

1. Relations

Now look at these two lists. They line up perfectly. If an "idea" is an individual, a "domain" is a class, and a "connection" is a relation, we see the similarity.

How do I spend my time when I'm trying to learn? Sometimes I read something, deeply. I take the time to study it and integrate the knowledge into my system as I go, painstakingly. I see this as increasing the depth of my knowledge. Other times I just wander. I might look up books by subject, browse weird WikiPedia sites, skim existing PDFs I have, or whatever. And often I find something this way. But when I find something, it's usually a shallower understanding. This is more like expanding the scope of my knowledge without increasing the depth. The third thing you might say I do is reflect, that is to ponder what I know now without going out to read what others have written. This seems to strengthen the connections between existing ideas I know about. This journal entry is a good example. I was sitting out in the backyard in a chair, when I felt urged to come and start writing this. I felt an urge to explore _how_ I, Joe Legner, personally acquire knowledge. And darn it if there was not immediately an interesting metaphor between my learning styles and ontologies. I made a connection between two domains today.

In fact, the concept of a metaphor seems important. What if our brain is a network of neurons that get strengthened from use. They like making connections between patterns. They see a pattern in the environment which triggers ideas in the mind. That set of ideas brought out by the environment might also be recognized as a pattern of its own, causing other ideas in the network to light up. Connections get strengthened by using them when thinking.

What about these three dimensions of knowledge?

- **Breadth

- How many domains I can talk about with some authority.

- **Depth

- How deep the authority goes in each domain.

- **Strength

- How effortless is the knowledge to access. How good am I at retrieving it.

What does a domain seem to include?

- That set of concepts currently held in the brains of individuals working in the field.

- Representations of all the domain's concepts in the form of representational artifacts: books, journal articles, video recordings, audio recordings, and other written and graphical artifacts of all kinds that can be used as representations of ideas.

- A social network which includes the was for individuals in the field to talk to each other and produce, store, maintain, and find the representational artifacts that record the domain's stored knowledge.

This is probably an appropriate time to go poke around in the world of cognitive science. The CRUM or Computational-Representational Understanding of the Mind seems like it has the potential to collect all these ideas into a single domain: a domain where mind and science intersect.

## The Stress Management Handbook {#id5411120222}

#5411120222

[#book](#book) [#stress](#stress)

I've been reading the first part of a book called _The Stress Management Handbook_, by Eva Selhub, M.D. I did so much that I ordered one so I can read it to Joey. I think he would really benefit from it.

I was awfully disillusioned with studying Spanish, among other things. Today I felt a little more positive. I think it is when I get tired that I get down like that. I should notice when I'm sleepy and keep that in mind through the day so I don't do something stupid.

Anyway this book has a list of words that you can use to sort of examine your emotions at a particular point in time. I thought the list was pretty useful, so here it is.

![Word Choices to Examine Emotions at the Moment](images/word-choices.png)

Size in the book says to think of a time when you were angry, and then pick out words from the list. After that, divide them into positive and negative columns, ostensibly to see that the anger causes negative emotions to arise. In other words, the author expects you to have more words in the negative column then in the positive column. I did, when I did it in my head.

The author invites us to investigate our emotions deeply and look for both the root causes and the patterns that exist, historically. I guess the thing that really stands out is my desire not to be criticized. I get angry and defensive when somebody questions me on something that I am confident about. I don't like people to go against my recommendation, because I hold myself in such high esteem, that I think I could not possibly be wrong about it. _They_ are! It might be childhood memories of my mom and her sharp tongue. It came out a little bit while we were up in Illinois this past week. She just has a mean and hurtful side to her that is not very deeply hidden. It's ironic, because it's like there are two of her. One is this kindly grandma type, but underneath is this little hurtful bitch. Little hurtful bitch doesn't come out very often, thankfully. That's probably because I have adapted my behavior over the years. I have avoided these hurtful little bitch. In the past it was probably because I couldn't handle the pain. Now I think I am a little more wise and worldly maybe? Did things a little better now maybe?

Why do I so dislike receiving criticism? It feels painful. I don't like others to disapprove of my performance. I want to be perfect, and I want people all to think I'm perfect.

## Types of Knowledge {#id4213060222}

#4213060222

[#knowledge](#knowledge) [#army](#army) [#ontology](#ontology)

I liked this list of the four types of knowledge from [army manual TP350-70-14](https://adminpubs.tradoc.army.mil/pamphlets/TP350-70-14.pdf).

The following are the four types of knowledge:

(a) Factual knowledge (terminology, specific details, and elements).

(b) Conceptual knowledge (classifications, categories, principles,generalizations, theories, models, and structures).

(c) Procedural knowledge (subject-specific skills and algorithms, subject-specific techniques and methods, and criteria for determining when to use appropriate procedures).

(d) Metacognitive knowledge (strategic knowledge, knowledge about cognitive tasks including appropriate contextual and conditional knowledge, and self-knowledge).

# Model-View-Controller (MVC)

This code snippet really makes the MVC concept clear to me.

```python
class Controller():

def __init__(self):
self.model = Model()                # create a new model
self.view = View()                  # create a new view

def handle(self, request):
data = self.model.get_data(request) # get the data
self.view.update(data)              # update the view
```

The controller seems to (1) own the model, (2) have a connection to the view, and (3) play the role of receiving and processing requests. It gets the data from the model, and then updates the view.

## Micro-Goals Revisited {#id5872320222}

#5872320222

I was thinking about the fact that I get a boost in mood whenever I do something wholesome. If I help someone or send my mother a kind text message, I feel good about it. It's got to be from a wholesome motivation. If I simultaneously feel compassion when I do it, it boosts my self-opinion. If something reinforces my self-belief, I should do it. In fact, if I did just some minimal amount of effort toward an area of self-actualization, I would be happy with myself. This, together with forgiving my frequent shortcomings, should be sufficient to sustain some degree of contentedness.

What if I did those wholesome activities daily, relentlessly, but without judging myself for the quantity or even quality of the activity? I just do not break the chain, even for a day, exercising. It might be a complete workout when I'm feeling energized and positive. It might be a long walk on a Sunday. It might be just picking up a dumbbell and doing some curls. It just needs to be time spent purposefully exercising.

Maybe I could do this by time-based wholesome micro-goals. Each micro-goal is just to spend _time_, no matter how small a measure of it, doing something _wholesome_. The first example of a wholesome activity is exercise. Let me brainstorm some others that might be candidates.

1. Spend time outside. Stretch: spend time in nature.
1. Spend time exercising. Stretch: do an entire workout.
1. Text a friend, colleague, or family member something wholesome. Stretch: meet up with a friend.
1. Help someone else. Stretch: do some charitable work or give to a charity.
1. Play music. Stretch: play out somewhere.
1. Learn something. Study.
1. Discover something new. Explore, outside, inside, or even online. Stretch: add an Anki card.
1. Celebrate something that happened today, no matter how big or small.


## I Think Too Fast {#id5895350222}

#5895350222

I have a powerful, quick brain. I am starting to realize I think faster than most people around me, at least when I am "on." The other day, a guy at work, who I already consider very bright, stopped a conversation and said, "Joe, I don't think I think as fast as you." This is a guy who recently recounted a story where he made someone else feel stupid in a meeting. That occasion was even inadvertent. He was smart enough that his normal conversation made someone else feel stupid, and I am smart enough that my normal conversation makes him feel slower than me. My usual disclaimer applies: I am not saying this to stroke my ego. I'm saying it as a lesson to my future self. Keep this in mind, and it will help you understand and relate to people better. You might want to slow down, be patient with others, let them take the time they need to understand something. You might need to plant seeds and water them to get something to grow. For the smarter folks, you might just lead them through the steps in your reasoning. For the very smart folks, you can lead them through leading _you_ through _their_ reasoning.

## PowerPoint Tips {#id2914060222}

#2914060222

[#powerpoint](#powerpoint) [#presentation](#presentation)

PowerPoint slides should be sparse. If the idea is to convey information to the audience, then speaking is a much more natural and fast way to do so. I can speak 150 words per minute. How many words per minute can you get reading slides? And honestly how much reading comprehension can you expect while you are also listening to someone speak to you? The ideal slide deck for me seems like it would consist of a lot of sparse slides with just a couple words or a picture, sprinkled with slides displaying tabular data.

Another not so bad idea might be to just read verbatim a pre-written report over that sparse slide deck. That way you do not make any mistakes. But the listener gets to passively receive the story from you without having to exert themselves to read it. Listening is easier than reading.

I could open a presentation with this:

> Ladies and gentlemen. My presentation is going to be a little unorthodox. I call it a lean presentation. I have a few sparse slides with talking points, pictures, or tabular data, and I will just talk over them. I can speak around 150 words per minute. That's a lot faster than you can read, and listening is easier than reading. Speech has better information density than reading, listening takes less effort than reading, and you can interrupt me and ask questions. It is interactive.

## Probability of God {#id5861780222}

#5861780222

Let $G$ be the event "God exists." If I have no idea either way if it is true, I would assign a probability of 1/2.

$$P(G) = 1/2 = 0.5$$

Now let us look at Bayes Theorem which says:

$$P(A|B) = \dfrac{ P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$

Let's rename the variables. We will let $A=G$ and $B=E$ where $G$ still means "God exists" and $E$ means "evidence." Bayes Theorem becomes:

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ P(E|G) P(G)}{P(E)}$$

$P(A|B)$ becomes $P(G|E)$ which means, "Probability God exists given evidence $E$." $P(E)$ means "the probability of evidence $E$." $P(E|G)$ then means "the probability of evidence $E$ if God exists."

We will re-write the equation in the form for a binary variable, because there are only two options. Either God exists $G$ or God does not exist $\neg G$.

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ P(E|G)P(G) }{ P(E|G)P(G) + P(E|\neg G)P(\neg G)} $$

OK, now what would I assign for the variables on the right-hand side? We already "know" that $P(G) = 1/2$.

What is the probability of a miracle if God exists, $P(E|G)$? If God exists, I would have no idea what he would do, so I have to assign $P(E|G) = 1/2$, meaning I am indifferent to whether or not he would perform a miracle if he existed.

What is the probability of a miracle if God did not exist, $P(E|\neg G)$? Here I would say that the proability is infintessimally small, say 1/1000000.

$$P(G|E) = \dfrac{ 1/2 \times 1/2 }{ 1/2 \times 1/2 + 1/1000000 \times 1/2 } = 500000/500001 =  0.999998$$

This is virtual certainty, which is to be expected. If a _real_ miracle happens, we can be damn shure that God exists, or $G$.

Let's look at the probability of a miracle, $P(E)$.

## My Top 5 Books to Reread {#id5872660222}

#5872660222

Nabakov once said:

> Curiously enough, one cannot read a book; one can only reread it.

My newest wacky idea just now is that I should have a core of, say 5 books that I re-read reguarly. The should contain a lot of information that is directly useful to me. Therefore, something general is better than something specific. They should be something either "timeless" or at least "state-of-the-art." They should be normative as well as informative.

A third worthy subject would be something on the lines of:

1. Arguing
1. Buddhism
1. Critical thinking
1. Engineering
1. Enlightenment
1. Ethics
1. Integrity
1. Law
1. Leadership
1. Logic
1. Math
1. Mindfulness
1. Problem-solving
1. Rationalism
1. Reasoning
1. Writing

There should be one book with subject matter useful to one of the types of "self" that I contain.

1. Physical self (B for Body)
1. Emotional self
1. Ethical self
1. Financial self
1. Social self

Or maybe these dimensions are better:

1. Personal
1. Interpersonal
1. Social
1. Business
1. Professional

Or the six pursuits of man:

1. Aesthetic
1. Moral
1. Ethical
1. Scientific
1. Economic
1. Political

Here are the candidates that come to mind so far.

1. _A Primer of Probability Logic_ by Ernest W. Adams.
1. _7 Habtis of Highly Effective People_ by Steven Covey.
1. _An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_ by David Hume.
1. _Extreme Ownership_ by Jocko Wilnic.
1. _The God Delusion_ by Richard Dawkins.
1. _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahneman.
1. _Lying_ by Sam Harris.

## My Noble Eightfold Path {#id5875630222}

#5875630222

**Right View**
: _Seeing things the way they really are_.
: I think I am better at this now than any time in my life.
: By small degrees, I am getting better at seeing through the bullshit and sympathizing with people.

**Right Intention**
: _Intending to renounce my demons, intending to have good-will toward my fellow beings, and having compassion for myself and other beings_.
: I have a pretty good score here. My demons are persistent, but I feel like I am wearing them down. Marijuana is an improvement from alcohol, for example. But why stop there?

**Right Speech**
: _Speaking with kindness and compassion_.
: I am doing better in this department, too. I do make a conscious effort not to speak harshly. I notice when I am speaking harshly.


**Right Action**
: _Not lying, cheating, stealing, and things like that_.
: I give myself high marks for the negative values here: not lying, for example. Any kind of positive value, like charity or generosity, is not a strong point for me.

**Right Livelihood**
: _Earning your living in an ethical and non-harming way_.
: I do this. I think my profession is an honorable one. I don't really lie or cheat to get ahead. I truly want to be promoted because I am the best. High marks for this one.

**Right Effort**
: _Putting forth effort to improve oneself in accordance with the Eightfold Noble Path_.
: I maybe get a B or C here. I do like to listen to Joseph Goldstein and even meditate a bit. I am always trying to get better. But I lack some willpower to reduce some unwholesome thoughts.

**Right Mindfulness**
: _The awareness that arises from paying attention, in the present moment, on purpose, and without judgment_.
: One area I need to work on here is the "without judgment" part. I am often judgmental toward myself and others, especially Julie.

**Right Concentration**
: _Practicing control of directed or choiceless awareness to achieve deeper levels of insight into reality and your inner life. Meditation practice_.
: I do try. It's not as much as it probably should be for my spiritual development and insight. Maybe as I get wiser, I will get more enthusiastic about it.

## Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge {#id0914060222}

#0914060222

[#writing](#writing) [#process](#process)

That heading, my friends, is a asyndeton -- the purposeful omission of conjunctions. But this is not what I am here for.

I came across some interesting writing advice from a book called _Legal writing in Plain English_ by Bryan Garner.

The book mentions a method Dr. Betty Sue Flowers of the University of Texas developed: the Madman, the Architect, the Carpenter, and the Judge.

The job of the Madman is to generate ideas. This means letting ideas flow about what you want to write about. The Judge must be kept away so the Madman can be uninhibited.

The Architect then comes in and organizes the ideas into an outline. This may be done non-linearly first, but the final deliverable from the Architect is the outline. The Judge must be kept away so the Architect can try out ideas freely.

It is important not to let the Judge interfere with the work of the Madman, the Architect, or the Carpenter. Keep the Judge away. He will delay the work of the Carpenter. He can wait.

## Journal of the Madman {#id5890870222}

#5890870222

It dawned on me that my journal belongs to the Madman. It is full of more or less disconnected ideas, serially written. Each one has enough information to remind me what it was about, but not excess detail. Each entry could be elaborated.

My flow should go like this:

- Work
- Meditate
- Daydream
- Explore
- Write an entry in this journal
- Add one or more Anki cards from the entry

## Supermemo Guy {#id5885710222}

#5885710222

I enjoy the writing of Supermemo Guy. Supermemo Guy is the author of the Anki predecessor, supermemo. Seems to be some kind of a eccentric creative genius. He writes all these articles on his wiki. He seems to maybe have some expertise in the field of learning and memory.


## Incremental Reading {#id5870480222}

#5870480222

What I have been doing for the past year and a half or two has a name. It is called "incremental reading." There is WikiPedia page on it.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading>

I read this, and I was like, "I do this now!" My process is as follows:

1. Read some random piece about a subject I am interested in at that moment. It may be a book or article or even a YouTube Video or a Podcast.

2. Spot some nuggets of wisdom in it.

3. Create Anki cards and add them to one of my many decks.

4. Study the Anki cards every day.

I am a little shocked at the moment. It's good that my method has a name and was invented by that weird Piotor character. The other day, I kind of skimmed his lenthy wiki article on incremental reading and was left confused about what it was. I even tried to watch him do it in realtime on a YouTube video. But I was not concentrating enough to see it clearly. Today I read the WikiPedia page, and now I get it.

## Prolog {#id4613060222}

#4613060222

[#prolog](#prolog) [#programming](#programming) [#computer](#computer) [#software](#software) [#language](#language) [#logic](#logic)

For no reason I suddenly got interested in Prolog. I've been reading about it and making Anki cards for several hours today. It all started when I was sort of daydreaming and brainstorming on the subject of "ideals" for my Ideal-Seeking System idea. Anyway, this is what I wrote on an Apple note.

| Each claim agrees with that which is.
| Each pair of claims agree.
| Each action promotes well being.
| Each agent knows that which is.
| Each agent knows what promotes well being.
| Each being is respected.
| Each action is kind.
| Each being is an end unto itself.
|
| Ideals are states of affairs.
| Means are ways to reach ideals.
| Actions apply means.
| Agents perform actions.
| Agents are beings.
| Skillful actions promote well being.
| Kindness promotes well being.
| Agents have minds.
| Minds produce thoughts.
|
| Free time means going where I am pulled. # 2021-09-12 More Prolog

```prolog
/* Facts in the form of simple atoms */
joe.
julie.
tommy.
joey.

/* Facts */
female(julie).
male(joe).
male(joey).
male(tommy).
parent(joe, joey).
parent(joe, tommy).
parent(julie, joey).
parent(julie, tommy).

/* Rules */
mother(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), female(X).
father(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), male(X).
son(X, Y):- parent(Y, X), male(X).
daughter(X, Y):- parent(Y, X), female(X).
```

Let's explain the first rule: `mother(X, Y):- parent(X, Y), female(X).`

This rule means "`X` is the mother of `Y` if `X` is the parent of `Y` and `X` is female". Given this rule, this would evaluate as true: `mother(julie, tommy).`

## Rust Guessing Game {#id5885670222}

#5885670222

Today I did the Rust guessing game programming chapter. Here is my program.

```rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;

fn main() {
println!("Guess the number!");

let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
let mut guesses = 0;

loop {
guesses = guesses + 1;

println!("I am thinking of a number between 1 and 100.");
println!("Enter guess #{}", guesses);

let mut guess = String::new();

io::stdin()
.read_line(&mut guess)
.expect("Failed to read line");

let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
Ok(num) => num,
Err(_) => continue,
};

println!("You guessed: {}", guess);

match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
Ordering::Equal => {
println!("You won in {} guesses!", guesses);
break;
}
}
}
}
```

I even made an improvement, which was to include the guest number when the question is asked, and to say how many guesses they won in.

## On Dictation {#id5899710222}

#5899710222

The best kind of writing would be writing that sounds good when it's read out loud. Speech is our normal way of communication. Reading is the newcomer. Good writing it would seem would sound like someone is speaking to you. The writer is speaking to you. So, what I'm getting at, is that I should probably speak my text more often. I could use my dictation more, not only because of this, but because I can type faster this way. I can easily get a lot of thoughts down without tearing out my fingers. Then I can come back later and put the finishing touches on it during the edit phase. You know, the Judge character.

I am going to wait five minutes, and then edit that paragraph.

The best kind of writing sounds good when it's read out loud. Think about it. When I read something, I often read it "out loud" to myself, in my head. By writing things that sound like speech, we are utiziling the innate machinery dedicated to speech that effortly recognizes, parses, conjugates, and finds the meaning of spoken speech.

I should use dictation more.

I can easily get a lot of thoughts down without tiring out out my fingers. That gets me the first draft. After that, during the editing phase, I can use the keyboard to apply the finishing touches, for accuracy.

## Rust Integers {#id5895880222}

#5895880222

| Signed integers in Rust: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, and `i128`.
| Unsigned integers in Rust: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, and `u128`.

The default integer type is `i32`.

When defining variables, long integers can be split up with underscores. The underscore is ignored.

```rust
fn main() {
println!("Hello, world!");
let x = 101_000;
let y = 101000;
println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
}
```

This results in:

```
Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.97s
Running `target/debug/playground`
Hello, world!
x = 101000, y = 101000
```

## Rust Floating Types {#id5877620222}

#5877620222

The two floating types are `f32` and `f64`. `f64` is the default type, because because on modern CPUs it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of more precision.

Here’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:

`Filename: src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
let x = 2.0; // f64

let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}

## Writing to a Specific Person {#id5881530222}

#5881530222

I read this in the _HBR Guide to Better Business Writing_ by Bryan A. Garner. Write to a specific person in your audience. Think about who is in your audience. I mean individual people that you know in the world. Then pick one of them who is both smart and a generalist, not a specialist. We would say that they do not have more specialized knowledge than the average member of the audience.

The point is to get it down to an individual person that you know in the real world, not some vague "type" of person.

For structural engineering issues, I could pick a mechanical engineer that I know. I could hone in on the mechanical engineers I know at TECO. But eventually I should narrow it down to one person. That way I can visualize them reading and interpreting it as I go.

What about Dru Latchman? She is pretty smart, and she has a lot of experience. She would probably understand the basics. Writing to her, I would avoid technical jargon like "cantilever". Then again, she might know that word. I could include it in parenthesis to acknowledge that possibility.

I would not write to Sam DeCubellis. He is too crazy. Maybe Brit Johnston would work. He is not particularly good at engineering, but that's average among the engineering managers. The thing is: I at least know him pretty well. I think he would work out better than Bob Bertig.

If I did something like this, I could do away with some formality.

> The purpose of this report is to summarize the findings of the assessment performed by the structural engineering team.

Could be written like this if I was writing directly to Brit Johnston:

> The structural engineering team assessed the structure, and this report summarizes their findings.

That has the feel of action and result, and it communicates all the information important to state the purpose to the reader.

## Read Article about Conditionalization {#id5862960222}

#5862960222

This is the article: <https://philosophy.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Proper-Formulation-website.pdf>

> "The central notion of Bayesian decision theory is credence (a.k.a. degree of belief, a.k.a. subjective probability)."

I like credence as a synonym for degree of belief and subjective probability.

> "Bayesians study an idealized agent who attaches credences to propositions."

This introduces some terms:
- agent
- credence
- proposition

This article does a good job introducing Bayesian decision making.

> "Imagine a person whose state of uncertainty is characterized by a 'prior' probability P0 ..., and who is not dogmatic about x, so that 1 > P0(x) > 0."

We have a mathematical definition of _dogmatism_ in the context of Baysian decision-making:

$$ P(x) = 1 \implies \text{ agent is dogmatic} $$

> "Factive formulations assume that the conditioning proposition is true. Non-factive formulations allow that the conditioning proposition may be false."

These are two new terms:
- factive
- non-factive

Consider this:

$$P(E|E) = 1$$

If $E$ is certain, than we must assign credence 1 to $E$.

> "All ordinary channels of epistemic justification -- - including perception, testimony, memory, introspection, and a priori reasoning --- are subject to error."

This is good. I might want to make this an Anki card.

## Idleness {#id5881900222}

#5881900222

The opposite of work is idleness.

## Going To {#id5892660222}

#5892660222

I was thinking about competency questions as project objectives. Like these:

- Is it going to work?
- Is it going to fit?
- Is it going to provide a benefit?

The answers to these are something like:

- It is going to work.
- It is going to fit.
- It is going to provide benefits.
- It is going to prevent losses.

This formulation of the sentence $X$ is "going to" $Y$ led me to a small insight. These would be very strongly worded objectives for a project. We can just substitue part of the scope into the statement for "it":

- The new system is going to work.
- The new system is going to fit.
- The new system is going to provide benefits.
- The new system is going to prevent losses.

_going to_ is a prediction of the way things will be in a time yet to come. It supposes we are on the path or _going toward_ this future state. But what state of affairs?

The last part after "to" is the desired end state, when married with the subject "the new system". What I mean is the desired end state is the state of affairs where _the new system_ exists and it is doing _work_. We might simply say, "the new system works" is the target end state.

Good writing displays facts. Bad writing displays itself.

## Ridiculously Good Writing {#id5892830222}

#5892830222

| **Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 75**
| LXXV. On the Diseases of the Soul

> You have been complaining that my letters to you are rather carelessly written. Now who talks carefully unless he also desires to talk affectedly?[1] I prefer that my letters should be just what my conversation[2] would be if you and I were sitting in one another's company or taking walks together, – spontaneous and easy; for my letters have nothing strained or artificial about them. 2. If it were possible, I should prefer to show, rather than speak, my feelings. Even if I were arguing a point, I should not stamp my foot, or toss my arms about, or raise my voice; but I should leave that sort of thing to the orator, and should be content to have conveyed my feelings to you without having either embellished them or lowered their dignity. 3. I should like to convince you entirely of this one fact, – that I feel whatever I say, that I not only feel it, but am wedded to it. It is one sort of kiss which a man gives his mistress, and another which he gives his children; yet in the father's embrace also, holy and restrained as it is, plenty of affection is disclosed.
>
> I prefer, however, that our conversation on matters so important should not be meagre and dry; for even philosophy does not renounce the company of cleverness. One should not, however, bestow very much attention upon mere words. 4. Let this be the kernel of my idea: let us say what we feel, and feel what we say; let speech harmonize with life.[3] That man has fulfilled his promise who is the same person both when you see him and when you hear him. 5. We shall not fail to see what sort of man he is and how large a man he is, if only he is one and the same. Our words should aim not to please, but to help. If, however, you can attain eloquence without painstaking, and if you either are naturally gifted or can gain eloquence at slight cost, make the most of it and apply it to the noblest uses. But let it be of such a kind that it displays facts rather than itself. It and the other arts are wholly concerned with cleverness;[4] but our business here is the soul.
>
> A sick man does not call in a physician who is eloquent; but if it so happens that the physician who can cure him likewise discourses elegantly about the treatment which is to be followed, the patient will take it in good part. For all that, he will not find any reason to congratulate himself on having discovered a physician who is eloquent. For the case is no different from that of a skilled pilot who is also handsome. 7. Why do you tickle my ears? Why do you entertain me? There is other business at hand; I am to be cauterized, operated upon, or put on a diet. That is why you were summoned to treat me!
>
> You are required to cure a disease that is chronic and serious, – one which affects the general weal. You have as serious a business on hand as a physician has during a plague. Are you concerned about words? Rejoice this instant if you can cope with things. When shall you learn all that there is to learn? When shall you so plant in your mind that which you have learned, that it cannot escape? When shall you put it all into practice? For it is not sufficient merely to commit these things to memory, like other matters; they must be practically tested. He is not happy who only knows them, but he who does them. 8. You reply: "What? Are there no degrees of happiness below your 'happy' man? Is there a sheer descent immediately below wisdom?" I think not. For though he who makes progress is still numbered with the fools, yet he is separated from them by a long interval. Among the very persons who are making progress there are also great spaces intervening. They fall into three classes,[5] as certain philosophers believe. 9. First come those who have not yet attained wisdom but have already gained a place near by. Yet even that which is not far away is still outside. These, if you ask me, are men who have already laid aside all passions and vices, who have learned what things are to be embraced; but their assurance is not yet tested. They have not yet put their good into practice, yet from now on they cannot slip back into the faults which they have escaped. They have already arrived at a point from which there is no slipping back, but they are not yet aware of the fact; as I remember writing in another letter, "They are ignorant of their knowledge."[6] It has now been vouchsafed to them to enjoy their good, but not yet to be sure of it. 10. Some define this class, of which I have been speaking, – a class of men who are making progress, – as having escaped the diseases of the mind, but not yet the passions, and as still standing upon slippery ground; because no one is beyond the dangers of evil except him who has cleared himself of it wholly. But no one has so cleared himself except the man who has adopted wisdom in its stead.
>
> I have often before explained the difference between the diseases of the mind and its passions. And I shall remind you once more: the diseases are hardened and chronic vices, such as greed and ambition; they have enfolded the mind in too close a grip, and have begun to be permanent evils thereof. To give a brief definition: by "disease" we mean a persistent perversion of the judgment, so that things which are mildly desirable are thought to be highly desirable. Or, if you prefer, we may define it thus: to be too zealous in striving for things which are only mildly desirable or not desirable at all, or to value highly things which ought to be valued but slightly or valued not at all. 12. "Passions" are objectionable impulses of the spirit, sudden and vehement; they have come so often, and so little attention has been paid to them, that they have caused a state of disease; just as a catarrh,[7] when there has been but a single attack and the catarrh has not yet become habitual, produces a cough, but causes consumption when it has become regular and chronic. Therefore we may say that those who have made most progress are beyond the reach of the "diseases"; but they still feel the "passions" even when very near perfection.
>
> The second class is composed of those who have laid aside both the greatest ills of the mind and its passions, but yet are not in assured possession of immunity.[8] For they can still slip back into their former state. 14. The third class are beyond the reach of many of the vices and particularly of the great vices, but not beyond the reach of all. They have escaped avarice, for example, but still feel anger; they no longer are troubled by lust, but are still troubled by ambition; they no longer have desire, but they still have fear. And just because they fear, although they are strong enough to withstand certain things, there are certain things to which they yield; they scorn death, but are in terror of pain.
>
> Let us reflect a moment on this topic. It will be well with us if we are admitted to this class. The second stage is gained by great good fortune with regard to our natural gifts and by great and unceasing application to study. But not even the third type is to be despised. Think of the host of evils which you see about you; behold how there is no crime that is not exemplified, how far wickedness advances every day, and how prevalent are sins in home and commonwealth. You will see, therefore, that we are making a considerable gain, if we are not numbered among the basest.
>
> "But as for me," you say, "I hope that it is in me to rise to a higher rank than that!" I should pray, rather than promise, that we may attain this; we have been forestalled. We hasten towards virtue while hampered by vices. I am ashamed to say it; but we worship that which is honourable only in so far as we have time to spare.[9] But what a rich reward awaits us if only we break off the affairs which forestall us and the evils that cling to us with utter tenacity! 17. Then neither desire nor fear shall rout us. Undisturbed by fears, unspoiled by pleasures, we shall be afraid neither of death nor of the gods; we shall know that death is no evil and that the gods are not powers of evil. That which harms has no greater power than that which receives harm, and things which are utterly good have no power at all to harm.[10] 18. There await us, if ever we escape from these low dregs to that sublime and lofty height, peace of mind and, when all error has been driven out, perfect liberty. You ask what this freedom is? It means not fearing either men or gods; it means not craving wickedness or excess; it means possessing supreme power over oneself And it is a priceless good to be master of oneself. Farewell.

#5863670222

| You shouldn't chase after the past

It's really just a concise paragraph conveying some wisdom, with dramatic pauses conveyed by indenting and splitting up long lines. I could do this. Just write something brilliant, and after that add dramatic pauses by indenting and splitting up long lines.

## Start of an Editorial Checklist {#id5860380222}

#5860380222

[_] Have I been utterly truthful?
[_] Have I said all that I need to say?
[_] Have I been appropriately diplomatic and fair?
[_] Do I have three parts to the piece—an opener, a middle, and a closer?
[_] In my opener, have I made my points quickly and clearly? And concretely?
[_] Have I avoided a slow wind-up that unnecessarily postpones the message?
[_] In the middle, have I proved my points with specifics?
[_] Is the structure immediately apparent to my readers?
[_] Have I used informative headings?
[_] Is my closer consistent with the rest—yet expressed freshly?
[_] Have I avoided lame repetition?

## My Life Commitments {#id5871700222}

#5871700222

It seems like I only have these commitments right now:

1. Supporting my family, financially.
2. Getting Joey set up as an independent adult.
3. Getting Tommy set up as an independent adult.
4. Saving enough to retire.
5. Maintaining my marriage.

I go to work because of Commitments 1 and 4. Any time I spend parenting the boys is for Commitments 2 and 3. These seem to group themselves together a little.

1. Providing.
1. Parenting.
1. Adulting.

I provide food, shelter, medicine, dental care, and clothing to my wife, my kids, my dog, and myself. I provide parental care and advice to the kids. I plan for their educational expenses. I try to make sure they each feel valued and supported. I try to do special things with them: with Tommy they are mostly guitar-related, and with Joey it's a grab bag of things. Driving is one. We previously gave running and working out with weights a try. And last, but by no means least is being a grown-up with Julie as my partner. This is a good commitment to have. I call it adulting.

## Letters to Joey {#id5861940222}

#5861940222

Julie had a good suggestion. I could start writing emails to Joey. I mean philosophical emails, emails that impart wisdom. They would be more like epistles or letters than emails. Picture, if you will, my own imperfect imitation of the epistles of Seneca the Younger and Thomas Jefferson. It's to learn to write as well as they do that motivates me to consider this project.

I have been recently reading books and articles about writing, especially ones written by Brian Garner. He is a lawyer who writes books about writing, written for lawyers. That's not why I am interested in him. I just love the quality of his writing style. It's a great writer who wants to write to me to help me become a great writer: win-win.

Bryan endorses a system of writing where you first brainstorm, then outline, then draft quickly, and finally revise and edit.[^macj] He calls it the Madman, the Architect, the Carpenter, and the Judge, names he adopted from an English professor named Betty S. Flowers.

[^macj]: I used some of this technique for this section of my journal. The parts I used were the Carpenter and Judge parts. First, I wrote the section very quickly, using dictation. Second, I re-read it and made edits along the way. And third, I read it out loud and made some final edits. I wanted it to sound natural when read aloud.

My aspiration, for the first letter at least, is to brainstorm each Tuesday night, outline Wednesday night, revise and edit Thursday night, and then do a final revision and send it on Friday night. That is a comfortable pace that will not be too much of a burden: I expect only 15-20 minutes per night.

I like the idea. Tonight I entered some ideas into a mind map, coming up with an assortment of topics in orbit about the concept of the letter-writing idea itself. Tomorrow I will attempt to outline.

## Word Count Analysis {#id5869660222}

#5869660222

Note, this section contains 328 words organized into sentences approximately 13 words in length; Bryan Garner recommends an average of 20 words per sentence. <https://countwordsworth.com/sentences>

## Letter Writing {#id5882440222}

#5882440222

These are some notes from inspecting the book, _How to Write First-Class Letters, the handbook for practical letter writing_ by L. Sue Baugh. I have it as an `.epub` file.

- Letter writing is a form of dialogue.
- Make your leters _recipient_-based rather than _writer_-based.
- Letter writing is a simple three-step process:
1. Prewriting, which means asking these four questions, and then gathering pertinent information on the subject:
1. What is my purpose?
1. Who is my audience?
1. What should the letter cover?
1. What action or response do I want?
1. Writing, which means writing the entire thing all the way through to the end. Just write until you have a complete letter.
1. Revising.
- Revising includes a lot of things:
- Challenging vague words.
- Deleting unnecessary points.
- Deleting unnecessary words.
- Deleting fancy words.
- Deleting irrelevant premises.
- Double-checking facts, figures, and references.
- Proofreading for grammar

I'm not sure I prefer this over the Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge model. I think I will marry the two. The part I like about this one are the four questions whenever you write a letter.

1. What is my purpose?
1. Who is my audience?
1. What should the letter cover?
1. What action or response do I want?

I came up with this killer checklist format today.

![Checklist Format](images/checklist-page_2021-09-25.png)

This could be thought of as a "needs to be" checklist. An item like this: _1. Affected Drawing List..........Created_ could be read as "and Affected Drawing List _needs to be_ created."

## Relations and Relationships {#id5867710222}

#5867710222

I was trying to figure out if object-oriented programming used the word _relation_ or _relationship_, so I did two Google searches to find out.

| `"oop" "relations" -relationships` gave 2,120,000 results.

It appears, then, that **relations

is the winner.

## Merritt {#id5892790222}

#5892790222

I have an idea for an app that lets you track things that you consider earning merit. I named it ironically after my grandfather, Merritt Davis. This gives it a distinctive name that will be easier to Google.

The minimum viable product would feature:

1. One list of activities.
1. The ability to check or uncheck items on the activities list.
1. A reset script that runs every day.
1. A reminder screen to check off items from the day before.
1. The date prominently featured at the top of the page.

## Risks in Society {#id5871770222}

#5871770222

When dealing with risks in projects, I wonder if we should always speak of "risk of X". Rather than just "risk". Mr. makes sense grammatically to me. Ask what the risks are, someone's response would be, there is a risk of A, a risk of B, and a risk of C.

![Risks in Society](images/risks-in-society.png)

For one event with potential consequences, risk, $R$, is equal to the probability that the event will occur, $P$, multiplied by the consequences given the event occurs, $C$.

$$R = P \times C$$

The formula is only provided as a foundation for the following formula, which would be for an activity with $n$ events that could cause consequences.

$$R = \sum_{i=1}^n P_i \times C_i$$

From this model, we can see:

- An activity, $A$, is associated with $n$ potential outcomes, $i$.
- Each potential outcome, $i$, has an expected consequence, $C_i$.
- Each potential outcome, $i$, has an anticipated probability, $P_i$.
- The risk of outcome, $i$ is given by: $R_i = P_i \times C_i$.

Let's try re-writing the formula, then.

$$x \in A, R(A) = \sum P(x|A) C(x)$$

| $A$ is an activity.
| $x$ is an outcome.
| $P(x|A)$ is the probability of outcome $x$ given activity $A$.
| $C(x)$ is the consequence of outcome $x$.
| $R(A)$ is the total risk associated with activity $A$.

What does _activity_ mean then? Take activity here to mean any activity from the smallest thing like walking across a room to larger things like projects. A project, then, under this model would be an activity, ontologically.

Now, let's go back and look at the table [Risks in Society]. The first column, "Approximate death rate", appears to be what Kahneman and Tversky would call "base rates."

The second column, "Typical exposure" is interesting. Recently learned that exposure is usually interchangeable with probability. But if we follow this table, exposure is not equivalent to probability. Probability would be exposure times base rate.

Third column, "Typical risk of death," is strange, too. I think it should be probability, not risk. The only thing that makes it risk is that the consequence is included: death.

Another insight from this table is that construction work is wildly riskier than structural failures. I should keep this in mind when making decisions.

"Risk of death" should be expanded to "risk of death for an activity is the base rate times in events per hour times the exposure in hours." Here _death_ is a consequence. The total risk for the activity would be the sum of the risk of each consequence given the activity, base rate, and exposure.

Item #3 techniques:

- Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)
- Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)
- Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)
- Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP)
- Risk Screening (Hazid Sessions)

For analysis of consequences (#4) consider using pairwise comparisons made by experts.

Base evaluation of probabilities (#5) on failure rates for electrical or mechanical systems and structural reliability for structures. Consider Monte Carlo analysis.

What if scenarios are used to analyze sensitivities (#7).

In risk treatment (#9) we compare calculated risks to acceptable risks stated in the risk acceptance criteria. Then unacceptable risks are handled by one of the following means:

1. Risk mitigation. Modify the system to remove the risk.
1. Risk reduction. Act to reduce the probability or consequences.
1. Risk transfer. Buy insurance, for example.
1. Risk acceptance. Adjust the risk acceptance criteria to accept the risk.

We then monitor and review (#10). This feedback loop improves the process.

## A Positive Affirmation {#id5899480222}

#5899480222

Add this positive affirmation to my Anki deck:

> "I am at peace with all that has happened, is happening, and will happen."

I think what it means is three things. You might as well be at peace with what has happened, because it cannot be changed now. It will be at peace with what is happening, because the causes of it are so complicated that you can't possibly control them. And likewise for what will happen. The chain of events from this moment forward is also not under your control.

## Do Myself or Delegate? {#id3579470222}

#3579470222

![TECO Salary Analysis 2021](images/teco-salary-analysis-2021.png)

taking into account all the hours I spend earning money at TECO, including commuting and free overtime, I make about $50 per hour in take-home pay. Some of that goes directly to 401(k) and savings.

When considering whether I should attempt to do something myself, I should use this formula:

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{P(S|M)} \geq \dfrac{\times C}{P(S|D)}$$

| Where:
| $S$ = Success.
| $P()$ = Probability.
| $M$ = Do it myself.
| $D$ = Delegate it.
| $C$ = Cost paid to delegate it.
| $P(S|M)$ = Subjective probability of success if I do it myself.
| $P(S|D)$ = Subjective probability of success if I delegate it myself.
| $H$ = Hours I estimate it will take me to do it myself.

Let's do a trial run here and look at Joey's neon light. I have tried over and over to fix it, unsuccessfully. That money is gone - a sunk cost - so I will ignore it.

I estimate my probability of success to be 50%. I am totally unsure if I can fix it. I estimate hours at 4. So the left-hand side becomes:

$$\dfrac{4 \times 50}{0.50} = 400$$

I estimate the probability of success of a delegated solution to be 99%. I estimate the cost as $500. So the right-hand side becomes:

$$\dfrac{500}{0.99} = 505$$

According to my formula, then, I should try to do it myself. It is close.

To be indifferent to the decision, we set the two sides equal. Then we can solve for $H$ that would make it worthwhile.

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{0.50} = \dfrac{500}{0.99}$$

$$\dfrac{H \times 50}{0.50} = 505$$

$$H = \dfrac{0.50 \times 505}{50} = 5.05\text{ say } \underline{5\text{ hours}}$$

## Joe as a System {#id5885750222}

#5885750222

## Our Family as a System {#id5872460222}

#5872460222

### Components

{ Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, possessions }

Possessions include all the things we legally control.

### External Systems

The external systems are infinite in number. We probably want to settle on a few of greater interest.

{ extended family, employer, consumer economy, legal system, government, social group }

### Resources

We have both tangible and intangible resources. Our possessions are tangible resources. The goodwill we have with other systems is an intangible resource we can tap into.

### System Benefactors

Benefactors include anybody who benefits from the family system. The family members are the obvious primary three.

{ Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Elaine, Bob, Terry, Ron, family, social group (all levels), society (all levels) }

The Users of the system are only the five of us dependent living things: { Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Maggie }

### System Life Cycle

| **Stage 1:** Joe and Julie
| **Stage 2:** Joe, Julie, and Joey
| **Stage 3:** Joe, Julie, Joey, and Tommy
| **Stage 4:** Julie, Joey, and Tommy
| **Stage 5:** Joey and Tommy
| **Stage 6:** Tommy

We are in Stage 3 right now. The next stage transition will be when Joe dies, moving to Stage 4. After Julie dies at a ripe, old age, Joey and Tommy will continue into Stage 5. Joey is older and so will die sooner, moving into Stage 6 until Tommy dies of old age. This is the system life cycle of the family of Joe and Julie.

### System Operating Domain

The family's sphere of influence extends at least as far as Europe. I don't know what more to say about this. It seems more applicable to systems like aircraft.

### System Frame of Reference

Our _physical_ frame of reference:

| The physical location of each system element (person or possession)
| 819 Walsingham Way, Valrico, Florida, United States of America
| North America
| Western Hemisphere
| Northern Hemisphere
| Planet Earth
| Earth's Solar System
| Milky Way Galaxy
| The Milky Way's Galactic Cluster
| The Milky Way Galactic Cluster's Super Cluster

There is one _temporal_ frame of reference:

- Current period in history

There is one _moral_ frame of reference:

- Current moral Zeitgeist

There is one _ethical_ frame of reference:

- Societal norms

Our _familial_ frame of reference includes:

- McCoy extended family
- Legner extended family

Our _social_ frame of reference includes:

- Friends of any family member
- Our neighborhood
- Our community
- Our county
- Our state
- Our country
- Western democratic society
- Western society
- Human society

### Higher Order Systems

Higher order systems govern, direct, constrain, and control the operation and performance of the Legner Family system. These systems provide resources for missions.

- Universal society (imagined)
- Intergalactic society (imagined)
- Interplanetary society (imagined)
- Human society
- Civilized human society
- International society
- Federal society
- State society
- County society
- Local society
- HOA
- Employers

### Purpose-Based Role

The purpose of the family is to benefit its benefactors. The vision is for all its benefactors to be thriving.

### System Missions

The family system performs missions in fulfillment of its purpose to achieve outcome-based performance objectives established by its owners and users.

- Provide what is needed for each family member to flourish
- Add value to higher order systems

### Mission Goals and Performance Objectives

Given the two missions above, what are the mission goals? Each goal must be supported by one or more specific objectives that are quantifiable, measurable, testable, and verifiable. This is something we need to work on.

- Goal #1: Safety
- Goal #2: Life-Long Learning
- Goal #3: Financial Stability
- Goal #4: Kids Independent
- Goal #5: Retirement

**Goal #1:** Safety

- Objective #1-1: Zero accidental injuries
- Objective #1-2: Zero violent crimes
- Objective #1-3: Acceptable self-reported mental health

**Goal #2:** Life-Long Learning

- Objective #2-1:
- Objective #2-2:
- Objective #2-3:

**Goal #3:** Financial Stability

- Objective #3-1:
- Objective #3-2:
- Objective #3-3:

**Goal #4:** Kids Independent

- Objective #4-1:
- Objective #4-2:
- Objective #4-3:

**Goal #5:** Retirement

- Objective #5-1:
- Objective #5-2:
- Objective #5-3:

### System Operating Constraints and Conditions

- Volitional acts are constrained by societal rules. This happens at many levels of description.
- The physical world is constrained by physical laws. This also happens at many levels of description.
- The system's capabilities are constrained by the family members' competencies.

### System Utility

The system provides physical, psychological, sociological, financial, and economic _value-added utility_ to its Users, namely the four family members.

- Physical
- Protection
- Health care
- Dental care
- Psychological
- Love
- Caring
- Kindness
- Sociological
- Teaching
- Belonging
- Financial
- Savings
- College savings
- Retirement savings
- Economic
- Income
- Insurance
- Legal services

### System Suitability

The family system is suited to providing support to its Users.

### System Success Criteria

Success means User acceptance and level of satisfaction. A User means one of { Joe, Julie, Joey, Tommy, Maggie }.

### Mission Reliability

This is the probability of success in accomplishing mission objectives for a specified mission duration and set of operating environment conditions and scenarios.

### System Effectiveness

Each stakeholder has its own opinion of the effectiveness of a system.

### System Efficiency

The family system is not very efficient.

### System Integrity

I'm not sure what _level of integrity_ means.

### System Sustainment

This includes the inputs needed to sustain the family system. Such inputs are obtained from outside the family system. For example, money, food, and all manner of manufactured products are all used to sustain the family system.

### System Promotion

The family system does not really promote itself. I would say this is not applicable.

### System Threats

Threats to the family are numerous.

1. Accident
1. Violence
1. Animals
1. Insects
1. Viruses
1. Bacteria
1. Financial problems
1. Betrayal

### System Concealment

The system does not conceal itself.

### System Protection

Protective measures include:

1. Locks and keys
1. Smoke alarms
1. Fire extinguishers
1. Insurance policies
1. Weapons
1. Passwords

### System Security

The family system is most concerned with physical security: PHYSEC.

### System Architecture

The system is a traditional human family consisting of two married parents, male and female, and two offspring, both male. It also includes a dog.

### System Capabilities

1. Provide money
1. Provide goods and services
1. Provide for physical needs of family members
1. Provide for emotional needs of family members
1. Provide education
1. Connects individuals
1. Defends against threats
1. Provides opportunities for growth

### System Concept of Operations

The two parents call the shots, but with significant input from the two kids. The dog does not have much say.

### System Phases, Modes, and States of Operation

1. Problem mode
1. Adventure mode
1. Normal mode

### Operating Norms, Standards, and Conventions

Family members:

1. Treat each other with respect and honesty
1. Speak and behave with integrity
1. Act with kindness
1. Help each other

### System Description

The system consists of a traditional human family with four human members and a canine.

1. Joe Legner, age 48, male, engineer.
1. Julie Legner, age 46, female, musician.
1. Joey Legner, age 18, male, student.
1. Tommy Legner, age 16, male, student.
1. Maggie, age 12, female, dog.

Joe and Julie are married.

The dog is adopted.

### System Sensors

1. Communications devices
1. Cameras
1. Recording devices

### System Behavior Patterns

1. School and work pattern.
1. School break and work pattern.
1. Vacation pattern.
1. Holiday pattern.

### System Responsiveness and Sensitivity

I don't know what to say here.

### System Interfaces

1. Meeting face-to-face
1. Email
1. Phones
1. Mail

### System Pedigree

The system pedigree is an unbroken chain of human families, most recently the immediate family of Joe's parents and the immediate family of Julie's parents. The system evolved from these two ancestors with a lot of wisdom and experience drawn from the world beyond the two ancestral family units.

## Rust Program Test {#id5891510222}

#5891510222

Refer to [2020-10-17 Nim Language Experiment]. I replicated this program in Rust as follows.

```rust
use rand::prelude::*;

fn main() {
let mut heads_rolled: bool;
let mut heads_count: usize = 0;
let mut tails_count: usize = 0;
let mut n = 0: usize;

loop {
heads_rolled = random();
if heads_rolled {
heads_count += 1;
} else {
tails_count += 1;
}
if heads_count + tails
}
println!("{} heads and {} tails", heads_count, tails_count);
}
```

The results were:
```bash
$ time ./target/release/coin_toss_rust
500651 heads and 499348 tails
./target/release/coin_toss_rust  0.01s user 0.00s system 87% cpu 0.016 total
```

| Language |  Time | Ratio to Python | Ratio to NIM | Ratio to Rust |
|----------|------:|:---------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|
| Python   | 1.150 |       1         |     16    |      72   |
| Nim      | 0.074 |        -        |      1    |      4.6     |
| Rust     | 0.016 |        -        |       -      |      1     |

Rust is easily the fastest. It makes Python look stupid. It is even about 5 times faster than Nim which is already much faster than Python.

## Entity and Component Architecture {#id5882880222}

#5882880222

1. An Entity is nothing but a unique identifier, usually an integer.
1. A component is a piece of data. It should be kept very atomic, but it can have more than one field.
1. An aspect is a set of components.

## Improvement Methodologies {#id5879580222}

#5879580222

<http://jamme.acmsse.h2.pl/papers_vol43_1/43155.pdf>

The **PDCA cycle

is a well known fundamental concept of continuous- improvement processes.

**RADAR matrix

provides a structured approach assessing the organizational performance.

**DMAIC

is a systematic, and fact based approach providing framework of results-oriented project management.

**DFSS

is a systematic approach to new products or processes design focusing on prevent activities.

## Entity Component System Architecture {#id5865520222}

#5865520222

```python
import random

class Entity:

def __init__(self):
self.key = random.randint(1, 0000000010)

class Component1:
def __init__(self):
self.data1A = ...
self.data1B = ...
self.data1C = ...

class Component2:
def __init__(self):
self.data2A = ...
self.data2B = ...
self.data2C = ...

class Component3:
def __init__(self):
self.data3A = ...
self.data3B = ...
self.data3C = ...

def create_entity_type1():
return Entity(Component1(), Component2(), Component3())
```

Let's try something a little more interesting.

```python
import random

class Entity:
def __init__(self, *args):
self.key = random.randint(1, 0000000010)
self.components = list(args)    # not sure this works, but you get the idea

class Position:
def __init__(self, lat, lon, draft):
self.lat = lat
self.lon = lon
self.draft = draft

class Bearing:
def __init__(self, angle):
self.angle = angle

class ForwardVelocity:
def __init__(self, knots):
self.knots = knots

def create_vessel(lat, lon, draft, bearing, velocity):
"A vessel is an entity with position, bearing, and forward velocity."
return Entity(Position(lat, lon, draft), Bearing(bearing), ForwardVelocity(velocity))

def has_component(entity, component):
"Return true if entity has component"
return component in [type(c) for c in e.components]

def has_components(entity, components):
"Return true if entity has these components"
retval = True
for component in components:
retval = retval and has_component(entity, component)
return retval

def physics_system(entity):
if has_components(entity, (Position, ForwardVelocity, Bearing)):
pass
# Now how do I get the data when I need it??


if __name__ == "__main__":
entity_context = set()
entity_context.add(create_vessel(lat=83.442, lon=66.4321, draft=8.5, bearing=53.5, velocity=4.5))

# TODO: create an over-arching loop
for e in entity_context:
print(f"Entity {e.key}")
physics_system(e)

```


Come to think of it, you don't need to generate random keys. Why not just start with zero? You will have to maintain a list of numbers so you can delete them in the middle when things get removed in the model. Each new entity just gets the next available integer. It's probably best not to re-use deleted ones, in case there is some kind of undo feature later. We will also have to keep track of the last number we generated.

On second thought, it would be better to keep it a simple list of integers. It could even be a list of booleans, because all you need is the position in the list and a boolean telling you if it is valid (True) or deleted (False).

Rather than delete from the entity context, I would probably just set the value to None.

### World Class

The entities, components, and systems (processors) should all belong to a world. Or maybe it should be called a "model". Anyway, something needs to own everything, including the system instances.

```python
entities = []
components = []
processors = []


class Beam:
def __init__(self, w, L):
self.L = L
self.w = w


def create_entity():
entities.append(len(entities))
return len(entities)-1

def create_component(e, c):
c.entity = e

if __name__ == "__main__":
create_component(Beam(L=24.5, w=0.94))


```

## Joe's Productivity Theory {#id2670720222}

#2670720222

$$P \geq D$$

$$P = R \times T$$

$$R \times T \geq D$$

$$R \geq \frac{D}{T}$$

$$T \geq \frac{D}{R}$$

$$R = E \times L \times (1 - W) \times U$$

$T$ = Time

$P$ = Productivity in units

$R$ = Productivity rate in units per unit time

$D$ = Demand in units

$E$ = Effort: 0=no effort, 1=greatest possible human effort that can be sustained indefinitely.

$L$ = Leverage: a number greater than 1, where 1 represents no leverage, only the amount of effort of a single, unaided person. Thus, a leverage of $L=2$ means twice the amount of effort of an unaided person.

$W$ = Waste: 0=no moment is lost, 1=no moment is productive.

$U$ = Utilization rate: 0=no time is productive, everything is training, staff meetings, or vacations to 1=all time is productive; there is no training, staff meetings, or vacations.

## Overtime {#id5875370222}

#5875370222

A year has 2,080 hours. From this number we must subtract eight hours for each holiday and vacation day. Subtract 9 holidays and 20 vacation days. This amounts to subtracting 232 hours for a net of 1,848 hours. We also need to subtract training and community service days. Let's subtract 6 days or 48 hours for those. We are now down to 1,800 hours, a nice round number! By this estimate, in one calendar year we are at work 225 days.

Now we have to get more granular.

There are many things that do not amount to a full day. The obvious ones is meetings of a kind that are outside of production. Most meetings are non-productive in this sense: you are not working on the work products promised by a project. You are working on a schedule or something outside projects. Let's assume, on average, that 2 hours per day is spent in meetings like this. Anyone working where I work would laugh at how low that estimate is. But assuming it is 2 hours, we are going to have to subtract $225 \times 2 = 450$ hours from productive working time.

How much do we have now? 1,800 - 450 = 1,350 hours available to do actual productive work. I am not saying we are productive during this work time by any means. We walk around, get a drink, use the restroom, check our social media, clip our fingernails, brush our teeth, and do a hundred other things. But let's say we are in busy mode. We do these little things, but we are pretty well occupied most of the time outside meetings. We can call it the "busy, not rushed" level of effort.

So, we start with 1,350 hours of busy, not rushed level of effort. Now let's talk about overtime.

Let's make everyone really busy, add two hours per day. This adds 450 hours of additional productive work.

Another thing to consider about the overtime: is it just as productive? It can't be. People get burned out and low, for one thing. People get worn out, during the day even.

Ignoring wear-out, we have increased our productivity from 1,350 to 1,800 hours. Not bad. This is an increase of 1/3. So, if an engineer could design 24 projects in a year without overtime, she could design 32 projects in a year with overtime.

But let's account for the weight of the overtime on productivity. This is a lot of overtime to sustain for an entire year. I think as time went on, people are probably going to check out, and we won't end up with even an hour per day of added productivity. In other words, even if you make them stay, you are not going to get more than 1 extra hour out of folks after indefinite lengths of time continuously working that hard. I am assuming all along that they are not paid for overtime.

Now we only get 225 more hours of productive work in a year. We have only increased our productivity from 1,350 to 1,575 hours. This is an increase of 1/6.

But what does this do for morale? Do we get more absenteeism? Do we get more turnover? Probably.

We would do 24 projects at a nice leisurely pace. With a ton of overtime, we will do 28 projects. Is it worth it? Why not have happier employees working at a nice flow and get 24 projects done, and retain everyone for as long as we want them.

![Inverted Organization](images/inverted.png)

## Anki Cards {#id5890420222}

#5890420222

I think my Anki cloze cards are excessive. Some go up to `c7` and maybe even `c8`. I wonder if I should make them more atomic. What would an atomic card be like? Here are some competing ideas.

- Each card conveys one bit of information.
- Each card conveys one binary relation.

Let's examine an example.

```
{{c5::Bhāvanā::Pali word}} literally means {{c1::developing}}, {{c2::cultivating}}, or {{c3::producing}} in the sense of "calling into {{c4::existence}}".
```

This card is about the Pali word Bhavana. It has five (5) cloze deletions. Should it? Is it really worth my time to memorize it verbatim? I don't think that adds value. The value is the Bhavana part. That's the new information I'm trying to learn. Let's re-formulate it more atomically:

```
{{c1::Bhāvanā::Pali word}} literally means developing, cultivating, or producing in the sense of "calling into existence".
```

This will save me umpteen reviews moving forward.

Here is another one:

```
Consider your {{c1::purpose}} and your {{c2::audience::a...}} before you begin writing, and let these guide both {{c3::what}} you say and {{c4::how you say it}}.
```

What's the point of this? Your purpose and audience should inform and constrain the writing process. Let's re-write it as its essence:

```
Your {{c1::purpose}} and {{c2::audience}} should inform and constrain the writing process.
```

## My Types of Close Notes {#id5863510222}

#5863510222

### Contrast Note

Some notes contrast two items. Here is an example contrasting the word "drastic" from the word "dramatic":

```
{{c1::Dramatic}} denotes attention-getting or extreme results, while {{c2::drastic}} refers to rapid, violent, or severe actions.
```

Could this be improved upon? Maybe it could become two atomic cards, for example:

```
{{c1::Dramatic::Dramatic | Drastic}} denotes attention-getting or extreme results.
```

```
{{c1::Drastic::Dramatic | Drastic}} refers to rapid, violent, or severe actions.
```

I did not make this change.

### Formula Note

Some give math, engineering, or financial formulas or equations.

### Image Occlusion Note

Some cards have a diagram, figure, photo, or map with features masked.

### List Note

Some cards have a list to memorize.

### Procedure Note

A procedure note gives a sequence of steps to accomplish an objective. For it to add value, it seems like all these should be true:

- Q1: Is it correct? Does it work?
- Q2: Does it come up often enough to be worth worrying about?

Here is an example from my current deck.

```
What are the five steps for hypothesis testing?
Step 1 - State the {{c1::null}} and {{c1::alternative}} hypotheses
Step 2 - Set the {{c2::threshold}} of the test
Step 3 - Assume the {{c4::null}} hypothesis is {{c3::true}}.
Step 4 - Calculate the {{c5::p-value}}.
Step 5 - State your {{c6::conclusion}}.
```

For this one, Q1 is true and Q2 is false. I should simplify or eliminate it.

### Quote Note

Some cards have sayings, aphorisms, or quotes that I believe are worth learning verbatim.

### Social Note

Some of my notes are for memorizing facts about people I interact with: the name of their spouse, their favorite thing, hobby, etc. These are intended to strengthen my social intelligence.

### Trivia Note

Some notes just give little facts I think it's fun to know or might make me look smart in front of others. Here is an example.

```
1 pound = {{c1::7000}} grains.
```

Is this useful to me? Not really. It's fun, somehow. Maybe it feeds that childlike want to be seen as smart.

### Vocabulary Note

Some notes just give word definitions. They are similar to the trivia notes.

## Prosocial Behavior and Self-Serving Behavior {#id5864550222}

#5864550222

My newest hypothesis having read this blog entry: <https://quillette.com/2021/11/29/the-universal-structure-of-storytelling/>

> Human psychology involves a tension between two opposing priorities: prosocial behavior and self-serving behavior.

The thesis of the article seems to be this claim:

> Storytelling developed as a way to indoctrinate and condition prosocial behavior in members of the tribe, with the good guys righteously opposing the bad guys.

The "good" part of the good guys describes behaviors that move the state of affairs _toward_ the flourishing of the good guys' group, and the "bad" part of the bad guys describe behaviors that tend to split up the good guys' group.

## Journaling {#id5890450222}

#5890450222

It's probably good to journal, because you are really thinking for yourself. You are not reading. You are creating something new from your own ideas. It seems like synthesizing new ideas from your existing ones is the best thing you could do to learn. You are doing what the gurus say: connecting the new stuff to the old stuff. You can even connect old stuff to old stuff. Either way is truly insight.

I went for a short walk tonight while I listened to Joseph Goldstein. I also smoked, so there's that. I definitely feel some emotional catharsis from doing it. It might also be that I worked hard enough to allow myself to really relax. I did enough. I can relax. That's not a feeling I have very often.

I have a hypothesis. Let's put it this way: Usually I feel guilty, like I should be doing more. I wonder if that goes back to the time my mom called me lazy. That stung a lot! Maybe this older being is still sore about it and always trying to prove her wrong.

I think it was right to make the preceding paragraph a hypothesis, by adding that first short sentence. You don't have to over-think things when it's a hypothesis. It's kind of light.

My three "Personas of Purpose," as I call them, are:

1. The Family Man
2. The Gardener
3. The Peaceful Sage

One time I created in Anki card that I ask myself, what does each persona of purpose supply and what does each demand? I got to thinking about it tonight, finally, which was probably the reason for the Anki card to begin with. I don't think we need to list things like necessities. They should be things demanded and supplied in the wrong themselves. It assumes there is a human body to take care of. Sexual release is not considered a necessity.

- The Family Man demands sexual release.
- The Family Man supplies money.
- The Family Man supplies love.
- The Family Man supplies care.

- The Peaceful Sage demands time.
- The Peaceful Sage demands effort.
- The Peaceful Sage supplies wisdom.

- The Gardener supplies advice.
- The Gardener supplies kindness.
- The Gardener supplies help.

"Care" means taking care of others, providing them with food, healthcare, and a roof over their head. These things are provided by money, but money is only a means to the ultimate end of the Family Man: caring for his family.

The Peaceful Sage seems to be about acquiring knowledge and wisdom. This is the Buddha-wannabe persona. The Peaceful Sage also has worldly knowledge, practical knowledge. The Peaceful Sage knows how to get things done and the science behind it. He is always learning, studying, improving. He enjoys new insights. He enjoys learning about himself.

The Gardener plants seeds and waters them. The seeds are selected by the Peaceful Sage. The earth is his circle of family and friends. It is a set of individual people that can talk to each other, so ideas can spread in a network fashion. The Gardener may plant a seed in one person only to see it sprout in another, but not being sure if it was his cultivating that got them there. But maybe it was. Maybe the good idea spread.

## My Sayings {#id5867990222}

#5867990222

I really have some great sayings, I just don't always remember them, and I certainly don't live them all consistently, though I think I'm getting better all the time.

> "I am at peace with all that has happened, is happening, and will happen."

Wouldn't that be great???

> "Substitute 'could' for 'should'."

I got this one from someone else, I'm sure, but I saw the wisdom and added it as an Anki Card.

> "Lock up the Judge and writing in a headlong rush."

I have a habit of editing while I am writing. I can seet that now. I have a strong pull to go back and fix something, when instead I should be "writing in a headlong rush" with The Judged locked away.

> "Meditation develops calm and insight."

This is pretty true, and I wonder why I don't meditate more often. I wonder if it is my mind pursuing since pleasures and so forth that interferes with me being able to meditate or being motivated to. My body is running the show.

> "Leaders develop subordinates."

I want to develop subordinates. I think I have a couple really good engineers, and I think I can help them be better engineers and better men.

> "Kindness, respect, truthfulness, timeliness, and wisdom."

For a while I was using these like a mantra. It's interesting that I don't think about them much. I was kind of surprised when I read the card, thinking, "Why haven't I said these recently?"

> "I forgive everyone who has hurt me and move forward with a cleansed soul."

This one is really Buddhist. What is the point of dwelling on the past, or brooding about the failures of others? Not to mention, the person that hurt me does not exist anymore! They have surely grown up and changed just as much as I have. I tend to have a conceit about myself, thinking that I am superior to others.

I am probably superior to a lot of people, but not everybody, and besides, I think it's possible to have more wisdom than me. I am following the tracks of those that came before me, and even though they lead me in the right direction, I have to appreciate _why_ it was the right direction by looking for myself. I wish I could have a long, unbroken conversation with some of them. That would be heaven to me. God, if you're really there and listening, I want to be able to just interview the Buddha, Jesus, Thomas Jefferson, Karl Popper, and 19-year-old I descended from.

## Some Random Philosophy {#id5890860222}

#5890860222

Saying, "That could have been bad" is strange. It definitely gives me a negative feeling. It is like a little punishment for a sin.

"That could have been bad" seems to mean, roughly, "What I just did, had things been a little different, could have resulted in a loss of something." We can shorten that to, "What I did increases the potential to lose something I value." It adds to the probability of a loss.

Do behavior that add to the probability of a gain event.
Abstain from behavior that adds to the probability of a loss event.

Behaviors can be thoughtful or thoughtless. The thoughtless is unwholesome. The thoughtful is wholesome.

The brain is the subject, and the mind is the verb.

The mind is what the brain does. If by mind you mean the conscious mind that is typing this, the mind is only one thing the brain does. It also controls the fingers. It has mechanisms ready to react to danger, idle most of the time. It's running low level operating system stuff. It's processing sensory input which cascades through the brain in all sorts of ways. It could be really, really interesting cascades of brain cell firing when you read this next word. Something that is not inside the brain gets shoved in, and it sets off a chain reaction of brain cell activity.

## Non-Self {#id5872740222}

#5872740222

The self is fictitious. It is a trick of the light. A brain feels like a self, for some reason. It's probably something to do with narratives. It's like the narrative style required a persistent object to represent the real, deep, ever-changing human animal.

## The Left Brain {#id5894400222}

- Finding meaning

#5873670222

```zsh
alias venv="[[ ! -d 'venv' ]] && python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate"
```

Now this command will create a new virtual environment called `venv` and activate it, unless it already exists.

```zsh

## Cute Proof of No Good {#id5887510222}

#5887510222

Let $H$ be a hypothesis, a claim about the world. Let $e$ be evidence found in the world.

$$P(H|e) = \dfrac{P(e|H)P(H)}{P(e)}$$

![Posterior Probability](images/posterior-probability.png)

The probability of a hypothesis $H$, given evidence $e$ is equal to the probability of the evidence, given the hypothesis, multiplied by the probability of the hypothesis, all divided by the probability of the evidence.

Now here comes the cute part. Let $H$ be the claim, "There is an all-knowing, all-powerful, and good god, like the Christian God," and let the evidence $e$ be "There is incredibly horrible suffering all the time, all over the world."  Let's shorten it to "there is evil."

We don't know the prior probability of God, $P(H)$. But this won't matter, because it gets swamped by the other term.

The term $P(e|H)$ is called the _likelihood_. For me, the likelihood of god, given evil, is zero.

Evil definitely exists, so the probability of $e$ is 1.

Now we can compute the posterior probability of god, $P(H|e)$ is zero.

$$P(H|e) = \dfrac{0 \times P(H)}{1} = 0$$

Therefore:

| P1: If there is evil, there is no God.
| P2: There is evil.
| C:  Therefore, there is no God. (Modus ponens)

## Throttle of the Heart {#id5870850222}

#5870850222

Positive feelings move the throttle of the heart forward, and negative feelings move the throttle backward. Stillness is in the middle.

I call this a "simile" because feelings are _like_ a throttle.

## No Self, No Problem Reading {#id1815060222}

#1815060222

[#buddhism](#buddhism) [#zen](#zen)

Language is a map. Categories are a map. And, like any map, the map is not the territory.

Pattern

A regularity in the world, in human-made design, or in abstract ideas.

The elements repeat in a predicable manner

Patterns have an underlying mathematical structure.

Language follows patterns. Our uses the subject verb object pattern: Joe ate fish. Another language might literally be Ate fish Joe but means the same thing as the English subject-verb-object pattern. Again, we have repeating elements whose repetition is governed by rules.

Patterns in time exist. Think of the sunrise-sunset pattern. We could think of it as patterns of events. The sunrise-sunset pattern may be one of the most ancient ones in our psyche. Weather patterns exist, where on a certain date in the year (event), we can likely expect a certain type of weather event. Managing patterns is about predicting the future. Predicting the future is about survival, at its most fundamental.

Maybe differentiating was the first step toward intelligence. The first organism that could differentiate between light and dark would have gained a competitive advantage, say by optimizing its behavior for the amount of light. It gave it another degree of freedom. Whatever it could do before it could differentiate light and dark, it could still do. Those are its prior degrees of freedom. But after it could differentiate between light and dark, it gained the ability to think. It could now adjust its behavior based on the light present. It might be as simple as not to move when it's light and to move when it's dark. This would be the first nocturnal animal.

Maybe these are the three steps in intelligence:

1. Observe
1. Recognize pattern
1. Categorize
1. Form a claim
1. Act

Spelling relies on our ability to see patterns.

A picture represents patterns in reality. We may see a drawing of Angelina Jolie and recognize the pattern: the shape of her face, her cheekbones, her lips, her eyebrows, and everything else. But that pattern is just in our head.

I recognize the concept Angelina Jolie when I see the painting. Angelina Jolie recognizes the concept of Angelina Jolie when she sees her own face in the mirror. Neither is more than a concept in the brain for a mere moment. It can be retrieved from memory but only lasts for a moment each time.

Intelligence is how much your pattern recognition hardware beats random luck. Random luck could be represented by a binary yes or no. This happens to be a binary digit or bit in information theory. So the intellect has added information to the system.

I started yet another Angband game tonight. This time I am trying as a high elf rogue named Shandalar. So far so good. Nothing special has happened, and I am only level 11 so far, but at least now I have Detect Monsters and Detect Objects.

After an accidental scroll of deep descent, I am deeper than I want to be. I'm having trouble even handling a few wolves. I got caught between a tiger and a panther, too. You know. I did kill the panther before I recalled it out of there for safety.

## Productivity Numbers {#id5887560222}

#5887560222

| $D$ = Demand (production units)
| $P$ = Productivity (production units)
| $R$ = Productivity rate (production units per unit time)
| $T$ = Time (time units)

$$P \geq D$$
$$P = R \times T D$$
$$R \times T \geq D$$
$$R \geq \dfrac{D}{T}$$
$$T \geq \dfrac{D}{R}$$

Let's decompose a little.

| $E$ = Effort: range $[0, 1]$
| $L$ = Leverage: range $[0, \inf)$
| $W$ = Rate of time-wasting: range $[0, 1]$
| $U$ = Utilization rate: range $[0, 1]$

$$R = E \times L \times (1 - W) \times U$$

## Algebra Review {#id5871840222}

#5871840222

| If:
| $$a = b$$
| then:
| $$ac = bc$$
| and:
| $$\frac{a}{c} = \frac{b}{c}$$

Definition of square root:
$$\sqrt{a}\sqrt{a} = a$$


Prove:
$$\sqrt{a^2b} = a\sqrt{b}$$

$$\sqrt{a^2b} = \sqrt{a^2}\sqrt{b}$$

By the definition of the square root:
$$\sqrt{a^2} = a$$

Square both sides of this equation:
$$(\sqrt{a^2})^2 = a^2$$

By the definition of square root, we see that squaring a square root term eliminates the root.

$$\sqrt{a}\sqrt{a} = a$$
$$(\sqrt{a})^2 = a$$

By this method we see $(\sqrt{a^2})^2 = a^2$ becomes:
$$a^2 = a^2$$

## Innate Social Emotions {#id5514230122}

#5514230122

The right brain seems to have built-in emotions of _gratitude_ and _compassion_ that make sense from the perspective of an evolved social animal.

Complaining
: The opposite of gratitude.
: Things should not be the way they are.
: Things should not have happened.

It seems as though complaining leads to anxiety and depression. It seems unskillful, unhelpful, and unwholesome.

## Right-Brain Buddha {#id5614230122}

#5614230122

> If you cannot control an emotion (like fear), then it is not part of your true nature.

Don't fight or suppress emotions. Notice and abide.

Maybe the Buddha's insight came from his right brain. He wants to teach us to use our right brain in a likewise manner, but to get us started he needs to use words: the discourses on the dharma, for example. All his words just prime our brains to make the same insight once we put ourselves in a position to make such insights -- meditation practice.

## Form and Void {#id3111230122}

#3111230122

> A thing becomes something when it contrasts with its background.

The background is the void. The contrasting thing is form. So it might be okay to assert:

> Void is form.

And likewise

> Form is void.

Correlary:

> Without silence, sound is not possible.

The space between parts makes the difference. Letters on a page need space around them to function as a communciation tool and a context of other words around it to communicate meaning. The letters and words are form. The page is void.

> Letters and words are form. The page is void.

About the right brain's big picture thinking we might say:

> The right brain sees the big picture: form and void together.

Another one is this, which seems to point to the idea of context.

> A figure is determined by its bakground.

Form and void is understood by the right brain [#4614230122](#id4614230122).

## Right Brain {#id4614230122}

If the right brain comes up with a solution, it does so intuitively, and it sends its recommendation to the left side in the form of a "gut feeling."

## Body and Mind in Competition {#id5714230122}

#5714230122

Maybe the body and mind are competing for supremacy.

- The body feels. The mind is numb.
- The mind predicts. The body senses.
- The way the mind feels is to induce the body to feel.
- The mind is embodied.

Stimulus leads to experience:

$$ \text{Stimulus} \rightarrow \text{Experience} $$

Also can be expressed:

$$ S \rightarrow E $$

The body is primary, because it stands between the stimulus and the experience of the stimulus in the mind.

$$ \text{Stimulus} \rightarrow \text{Body} \rightarrow \text{Experience} $$

$$ S \rightarrow B \rightarrow E $$

## Permutations Experiment {#id4017240122}

#4017240122

I added an Anki card for permutations a few days ago, and it said the members of our family (4 humans + 1 dog) taken in groups of 3 would yield 60 permutations. I tested this using this Python code:

```python
from itertools import permutations

i = 0
for p in list(permutations(("Joe", "Julie", "Joey", "Tommy", "Maggie",),3)):
print(f"{i+1}. {p}")
i=i+1

print(f"{i} total permutations")
```

Here are the results, confirming my hypothesis.

[#math](#math) [#logic](#logic)

> In mathematical logic, a theory is complete if, for every closed formula in the theory's language, that formula or its negation is demonstrable.

closed formula
: A closed formula has no free occurrences of any variable.
: A formula having only bound variables.

free variable
: A free variable is a notation (symbol) that specifies places in an expression where substitution may take place and is not a parameter of this or any container expression.
: Some older books use the terms real variable and apparent variable for free variable and bound variable, respectively.
: The idea is related to a placeholder (a symbol that will later be replaced by some value), or a wildcard character that stands for an unspecified symbol.

In this formula, $k$ is bound and $n$ is a free variable. We can substitute anything for $n$, but $k$ gets values from 1 to 10 because of the summation notation.

$$ \sum_{k=1}^{10} f(k, n) $$

demonstrable
: Provable (I think).

## Joe's Zettel ID Format {#id0820290122}

#0820290122

[#zettelkasten](#zettelkasten) [#tag](#tag) [#format](#format)

This is my final Zettel ID format I am going to adopt, starting today, January 29, 2022. It is a 2-digit year. Why keep writing the 2-0 in front of it for the rest of my life? I'm not going to see 2100. The next 4 digits are the 2-digit month and 2-digit day. The next four are the 24-hour clock time, down to the minute only. These zettels are going to be hand-made, so I'm not going to be cranking them out within a minute.

New Zettelkasten Format: `#YYmmDDHHMM`

For example, on Saturday, January 29, 2022 at 8:18 pm, the new zettel ID would be: `1820290122`.

Zettelkasten Format 3: `#MMHHDDmmYY`. I reversed the components of the zettelkasten ID. The reason for this is so that the part that varies a lot (minutes and hours) will now be at the beginning of the zettel. The part that rarely changes (months and yearS) will be at the end. So it will be easier to distinguish two zettels from each other.

Another thing I noticed is that I have some ability to create zettel IDs that will never accidentally be overwritten by a datetime-based zettelkasten ID. Let's see what degrees of freedom we have with the minute+hour+day+month+year format.

- Minute: 60-99 (40).
- Hour: 60-99 (40).
- Day: 32-99 (68).
- Month: 13-99 (87)
- Year: 00-21 (22). We could also assume I will be dead before a certain decade and use numbers in that decade, but why bother.

$$ 40 \times 40 \times 68 \times 87 \times 22 = 208,243,200 $$

This gives us a lot of opportunities for non-datetime based zettel IDs.

Actually, I think it's better than that. Once we set the first two digits, the rest of the digits can be anything at all. We know we won't collide with a time-based zettel ID, because we started with 60 or more minutes. These don't exist on the clock, so we are guaranteed not to have a duplciate.

- Minute: 60-99 (40).
- Hour: 00-99 (100).
- Day: 00-99 (100).
- Month: 00-99 (100)
- Year: 00-99 (100).

$$ 40 \times 100 \times 100 \times 100 \times 100 = 40 \times 10^{8} =  4,000,000,000$$

> Zettel IDs that start 60-99 are not based on time. There are 4 billion available.

## Zettelkasten ID 60-99 {#id4706170222}

#4706170222

[#zettelkasten](#zettelkasten)

There are 40 numbers from 60-99, inclusive.

Sequential list:

```
60 / 61 / 62 / 63 / 64 / 65 / 66 / 67 / 68 / 69 / 70 / 71 / 72 / 73 / 74 /
75 / 76 / 77 / 78 / 79 / 80 / 81 / 82 / 83 / 84 / 85 / 86 / 87 / 88 / 89 /
90 / 91 / 92 / 93 / 94 / 95 / 96 / 97 / 98 / 99
```

Shuffled list:
```
79 / 78 / 91 / 69 / 73 / 82 / 83 / 98 / 99 / 70 / 66 / 81 / 74 / 88 / 67 /
71 / 77 / 68 / 62 / 85 / 72 / 94 / 75 / 76 / 63 / 80 / 92 / 84 / 96 / 97 /
89 / 93 / 87 / 61 / 95 / 64 / 65 / 86 / 60 / 90
```

This was all generated by this Python code.
```python
from random import shuffle

if __name__ == "__main__":
numbers = ["%02d" % i for i in list(range(60,100))]
print(f"There are {len(numbers)} numbers:")

print(two_digits1+"\n")
shuffle(numbers)
two_digits2 = " / ".join(numbers)
print(two_digits2+"\n")
```

## Zettelkasten ID Renaming {#id0013060222}

#0013060222

[#zettelkasten](#zettelkasten) [#vscode](#vscode)

When I changed from `YYmmDDHHMM` to `MMHHDDmmYY`, I used this search and repalce in VS Code.

Regular expression search: `#.+(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})(\d{2})`

Replace substitution: `$5$4$3$2$1`.


## Find Replace with Regular Expression in VS Code {#id1020290122}

#1020290122

[#regex](#regex) [#vscode](#vscode)

I used an interesting way to find and replace the Zettel IDs using VS Code. I wanted to find something of this format: 1020290122 and snip off the first two digits (here 20) and the last two digits (here 00), leaving myself with 1020290122.

1. Opened the VS Code Search feature.

1. Clicked on the button to put it in RegEx mode.

1. Entered in the find box `(20)(2201\d{6})(\d{2})`

1. Entered in the replace box `$2`.

How does this work?

It matches 20. Notice that the 20 is wrapped by parentheses, so it becomes a result. The `$0` result is the entire matched string, so the first parenthetical expression becomes the `$1` result.

The term `(2201\d{6})` matches the 2nd two digits of the year, the 2 digits of the month, and the 2 digits of the day, but excludes the seconds. The last term `(\d{2})` matches the last two digits.

The replace value of `$2` means it returns the part of each string matched by `(2201\d{6})`.

Running this on the string `1020290122` results in these values:

- `$0 = 1020290122`
- `$1 = 20`
- `$2 = 1020290122`
- `$3 = 00`

As you can see, the middle one is the one we want.

### Zettel
| A zettel is analygous to a slip of paper.
| Each zettel has a unique 10-digit ID: `YYMMDDHHMM`
| Each zettel has a name or "slug".
| The body of a zettel is Markdown.

### Link
| A link is a connection between two zettels.
| A link has a reference to zettle A.
| A link has a referenze to zettel B.

### Pony ORM

```python
class Zettel(db.Entity):
zid= Required(str)
name = Required(str)
body = Required(str)
zettels = Set('Zettel')
```

This could not be more simple.

We would create a new zettel like this:

```python
>>> z1 = Zettel(name="Zettel", body="A slip of paper with an ID, name, and body (content) used as a way to record concepts")
>>> z2 = Zettel(name="Schema", body="A mental map or pattern of thought")
>>> z1.zettels.add(z2)  # Not sure about this syntax anyway
```

But this is not what I want. The link between two zettels needs a _reason_ attached to it. I would want to connect the idea of a zettelkasten with the idea of a schema, _because_ the idea of a zettlekasten _is_ a schema.

In keeping with the tradition of RDF, let's rename our Zettle class to Node and create a Property class.

```python
class Node(db.Entity):
zid= Required(int)
name = Required(str)
body = Required(str)

class Property(db.Entity):
owner = Required(Node)
target = Required(Node)
reason = Required(str)
```

Now all I need is a graph containing the nodes and properties.

```python
class Graph(db.Entity):
nodes = Set(Node)
properties = Set(Property)
```

### `__main__` for Pony ORM Zettelkasten Program

```python
# __main__.py

if __name__ == "__main__":
# Database initiation stuff goes here

# Create two nodes
n1 = Node(name="Python", body="The [Python Programming Language](https://python.org) is an interpreted computer language.")

n2 = Node(name="Programming Language", body="A programming language is a set of symbols, syntax, and semantic rules that govern instructing a computer to do something.")

# Add a property to link n1 to n2
p1 = Property(owner=n1, target=n2, reason="is a")
```

### Simplification

```python
class Node(db.Entity):
zid= Required(int)
name = Required(str)
body = Required(str)
properties = Set('Property')

class Property(db.Entity):
target = Required(Node)
reason = Required(str)
```

## Zettlecasten Randomness {#id0822260122}

#0822260122

This code tries to randomize the creation of 90,000 zettel numbers per lifetime. I used it to simulate lifetimes. The results were best when I started with 10 billion and ended at 99,999,999,999. Randomizing over that size of numbers led to 25 straight lifetimes of creating 90,000 zettels without a duplicate within one lifetime.

## Worldview Definition {#id3209100222}

#3209100222

[#philosophy](#philosophy) [#logic](#logic) [#critical-thinking](#critical-thinking)

`axioms.pdf` defines a worldview this way:

> A worldview is a set of propositions that defines a consistent mental model of the Universe and serves as the basis for reasoned volitional action and knowledge.

Let's parse this a little.

First, it is a _set_, like a mathematical set. Members of this set are by definition _propositions_. Each proposition is a statement of the kind that may be taken either as _true_ or _false_ but not both. To be _consistent_ is not to contradict itself. It might not matter if it contradicts other worldviews. Then again, it seems like it always will, because any worldview must be _personal_ and _subjective_. It is fed into the faculty of _reason_ to plan _volitional action_. Knowledge is the map the reason uses to plan its volitional actions.

> Worldview is how the brain makes sense of it all.

> A worldview is epic, meaning it is the stuff of stories.

For beings who, according to David Hum, are incapable of reasoning with certainty about the future, humans seem to do a pretty damn good job of predicting the future.

## Eiffel {#id5720100322}

[#eiffel](#eiffel)

Eiffel consists of methodology and notation:

- The Eiffel development _methodology_
- The Eiffel programming language: a _notation_ for the methodology.
- Development environments
- EiffelStudio
- EiffelEnvision

### Eiffel Language

Simple and readable. It supports a software development methodology. It's not just an object model.

| Class
|     Feature
|         Attribute (returnes a value)
|         Procedure (does not)

Functions and attributes are both _queries_ because the object can be queried using either one of them. A procedure (also called a routine) is a sequence of statements that can change the value of an attribute. A function cannot change an attribute, only a procedure can. This is a design principle called "command-query separation."

### Eiffel Compilation

Eiffel is compiled to ANSI C and then is compiled by the local compiler. This is why the language Eiffel is so portable: it's as portable as ANSI C.

> Eiffel is as portable as ANSI C.

### EiffelVision2

This is the GUI component.

Console.WriteLine("Attempt #2");
sum = 0;
for (i = 0; i <= 20; i += 3)
{
Console.WriteLine(i);
sum += i;
}
Console.WriteLine($"The sum from Attempt #2 is {sum}");
}

```

Here is the output from the console.
```bash
Attempt #1

15
18
The sum from Attempt #1 is 63
Attempt #2
0
3
6
9
12
15
18
The sum from Attempt #2 is 63
```

Both answers were correct.

## Worldview Meta-Axioms {#id2019210322}

#2019210322

[#philosophy](#philosophy) [#critical-thinking](#critical-thinking) [#logic](#logic) [#bayes-theory](#bayes-theory) [#coxs-theorem](#coxs-theorem)

1. **Unprovability** – An acceptable axiomatic worldview must be unprovable and incomplete (to allow it to be consistent, so far).

2. **Mathematics and Logic** – Axiom sets leading to consistent theories of symbolic reason are acceptable for inclusion in a worldview.

3. **Real Plausibility** – Degrees of plausibility (of the truth of proposed world- view axioms or consequent theorems) may be represented by real numbers (or well-approximated by discretized e.g. binary representations or ordinal analogue electromechanical states of e.g. neurons).

4. **Common Sense** – Plausibilities can only change in qualitative correspon- dance with common sense.

5. **Consistency** – The complete network of mutually related axioms, theorems, and beliefs with their real-number plausibilities should be quantitatively consistent.

6. **Honesty** – Axiomatic worldviews that are built upon and supported by an honest, open, and well-founded process are better than worldviews that are based on lies, on contradictory propositions, or on evidence corrupted by (de facto dishonest) confirmation bias.

7. **Predictivity** – Axiomatic worldviews that (both) correspond well to the world of our past experience and predict or explain new experiences are better than worldviews that have a poor correspondence to our experience and/or have less predictive skill.

8. **Ockham’s Razor** – Axiomatic worldviews that are simpler (e.g. are parsimonious, have fewer axioms) are better/more plausible than worldviews that are more complex, all other things being equal.

9. **Aesthetics** – Given two worldviews of similar complexity that do equally well at consistently explaining experience and evidence, the one that is most beautiful is (marginally, narrowly, barely) best.

10. **Open-Mindedness** – Don’t ever assume that your worldview – or anyone else’s – is the best one, only that it is the best one you’ve found – so far. Never assume that somebody else’s worldview is completely wrong (if it isn’t as good as yours in some way), only that it may be less likely to be correct based on what your experience and most plausible belief set indicate – so far.

11. **Perversity** – Beware the general perversity of the Universe; it has many parts. Allow for it in your worldview. Be humble, you know less than you think you know (no matter what you think you know). Check for metaphorical cobras under your metaphorical bed while building worldviews.

## Object-Manipulator Pattern {#id1320230322}

#1320230322

[#programming](#programming) [#oop](#oop) [#design-patterns](#design-patterns)

I have this idea for an object and manipulator. The object only has data. The manipulator has skills that can manipulate a specific type of object. The object has to have an interface the manipulator understands. The key points here are data is in the object class and behavior is in the manipulator class.

Let's invent a fake example

```csharp
interface IStructure
{
// Properties a structural engineer expects
}

class Building : IStructure

// Code to create an object of type Building

StructuralEngineer.Design(building);

static class StructuralEngineer
{
public void Design(IStructure structure)
{
// Design behavior code goes here.
// Changes the state of building.
}
}
```

This seems pretty cool. Let's do more. As long as the building has a certain interface, we can add other types of engineers.

```csharp
interface IPlumbingSystem
{
/// Properties a structural engineer expects
}

class PlumbingSystem : IPlumbingSystem

// Code to create a building

// Code to add a plumbing system to the building

MechanicalEngineer.Design(building.plumbing_system);

static class MechanicalEngineer
{
public void Design(IPlumbingSystem plumbingSystem)
{
// Design behavior code goes here.
// Changes the state of building.
}
}
```

### Introducing Skills

Maybe it would be better for the engineer to have skills. Each skill is a class that expects a certain interface from its objects. The target interface for a FootingDesignSkill class would have properties for length, width, and thickness.

We could, of course, do away with the interface entirely and merely specify a class of a certain type is required for manipulation by the engineer.

```csharp
class Footing { };
var footing = new Footing();
StructuralEngineer.DesignFooting(Footing footingToDesign) { }
```

The engineer could also have writing skills.
```csharp
StructuralEngineer.ReportFooting(Footing footingToReport) { }
```

## VirtualFooting {#id4621230322}

#4621230322

[#programming](#programming) [#csharp](#csharp) [#engineering](#engineering)

To get really precise about things, we should speak of virtual system manipulated by a virtual engineer, all in a virtual environment. If we want to design a footing, we really design a VirtualFooting. It is an abstract idea only, but we treat it like it is a physical object.

The more radical part would be to treat the engineer as a virtual person. As a virtual person, they have virtual skills that allow them to manipulate virtual objects. They might design a virtual footing first and then write a virtual report (computer file) about it.

Later, the virtual report can turn into a physical report when it is printed. Then a real person can read the real report and use it to build the real footing.

## Engineered Structure Grammar V0.0.1 {#id4920310322}

#4920310322

[#structural-engineering](#structural-engineering) [#programming](#programming) [#grammar](#grammar) [#parser](#parser)

I was playing around with a programming language for structures.

```
# Hashtag is used for a comment
Project
Name = Custom Home
Engineer = Joe Legner

Report
Revision = 0
Date = today

Soil uno
Density = 110 pcf
Friction angle = 30 deg

Soil 1

Soil 2
Density = 120 pcf

# uno means "unless noted otherwise"
Basement wall uno
Rebar grade = 60
Concrete strength = 4000 psi
Concrete density = 145 pcf
Height = 12 feet
Backfill height = 12 feet
Thickness = 10 or 12 inches
Soil = Soil 1

Basement wall 1
# This will get default values from the uno instance

Basement wall 2
Backfill height = 5 feet
Thickness = 8 inches
```

Let's try to write a simple grammar. This is not a real grammar. I have not bothered to put in all the whitespace characters and make sure the line is indented using a tab. That would take a lot of time, and I'm just playing around. I could certainly expand this later to include those things and create a proper Antlr input file. This is just for a start.

```antlr
<input file> ::= <project> | <project><report> | <project><report><components>
<components> ::= <component> | <components><component>
<component> ::= <component name> | <component intro><property assignments>
<unless noted otherwise> ::= uno
<component name> ::= <component type><unless noted otherwise> | <index number>
<property assignments> ::= <property> | <property><property assignments>
<property> ::= <property name> = <value specification>
<value specification> ::= <denominate number> | <number> | <component name>
<denominate number> ::= <number> | <number><units>
<units> ::= psi | pcf | feet | inches
<number> ::= <integer> | <decimal number>
<decimal number> ::= <integer>.<integer>
<digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
<integer> ::= <digit> | <digit><integer>
<character> ::= a | b | c | d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z
<word> ::= <character> | <word><character>
<component name> ::= <word>|<word><word>
<component type> :: = Basement wall | Soil
```

I would need to add a lot of things like `<concrete component>` so that I can limit what component types get a concrete strength property.

It also needs to accept string values for the properties of the project. And we will need a rule for the `today` token. Maybe functions should be in parentheses like this:
```
Report
Date = (today)
```

I would probably add comments of the Python style, starting with a `#` character.

There will be a lot of rules required for designing things. This toy example has the `Thickness = 10 or 12 inches` rule. It might be better to have:
```
Basement wall 1
Thickness = (design)
Minimum thickness = 10 inches
Maximum thickness = 12 inches
```

A new syntax idea:
```
Soils, uno
# Default properties

Basement walls, uno
# Default properties
```

## Real World Analogy Classes Schema {#id5014080422}

#5014080422

[#programming](#programming) [#schema](#schema)

What is we made classes like we manipulate things in the real world?

- `class Engineer` knows how to design a structure.
- `class Structure` represents a virtual structure, containing data about itself.
- `class SpreadFooting` represents a single virtual footing in a structure.
- `class Skill` would include instances for structural analysis, concrete design, steel design, and report building. An `Engineer` object would have one or more `Skill` objects. An alternate idea for `Skill` would be `Manipulator`, because it manipulates structures.
- `class Document` would represent a virtual document, such as a calculation or design report.

## Analysis and Design Schema {#id5514080422}

#5514080422

[#schema](#schema) [#programming](#programming) [#structural-engineering](#structural-engineering) [#eiffel](#eiffel)

The Eiffel programming system has very clear ideas about things, including queries and commands. A query asks something of an object but does not change it. A query does not have any side-effects either. A command, on the other hand, changes the internal state of the object. We can relate this to engineering skills of analysis and design.

- The engineering skill of **analysis** is analogous to the Eiffel **query** concept.
- The engineering skill of **design** is analogous to the Eiffel **command** concept.

## Freedom, Adventure, and Pleasure {#id1710150422}

#1710150422

[#philosophy](#philosophy) [#rebt](#rebt)

I tentatively sketched out these three goals while I was thinking about REBT (rational emotive behavior therapy). They seem hedonistic at first glance. But it's OK if they are hedonistic, because of the USA principle of REBT: unconditional self acceptance.

### Freedom

I desire to have maximum freedom to achieve my other goals in life, namely [Adventure] and [Pleasure]. This would mean eliminating as many of the constraints to thought and action as possible. What are some constraints?

- Body
- Injury
- Illness
- Fatigue
- Mind
- Depression
- Embarassment
- Fear
- Guilt
- Inhibitions
- Shame
- Worry / anxiety (severe)
- Social
- Political oppression

There is a lot implied by this list. For example, to minimize guilt implies action based on kindness, respect, truthfulness, timeliness, and wisdom. To minimize health problems means eating well, exercising, and resting. To minimize embarassment means grooming, staying in shape, and cultivating interpersonal tact. I take care of myself so I can go on adventures and seek pleasures, body and mind.

### Adventure

By maximizing my [Freedom] I can have adventures in the world that may result in [Pleasure]. Adventure is about trying new things, meeting new people, and traveling to new places.

### Pleasure

Pleasure need not only be hedonistic. Here are some categories of things I enjoy.

- Hedonism
- Sex
- Food
- Drink
- Relaxation
- Learning new things
- Friendship
- Conversation

I'm not positive that [Adventure] should be a different goal. Then again, adventure seems to imply gaining new experiences, not all of which will be pleasurable. There is a risk of displeasure. So maybe I will keep them separate for the time being.

[#philosophy](#philosophy) [#bayes-theory](#bayes-theory)

| $P(x)$ = Probability of $x$.
| $G$ = The (Christian) God exists.
| $m$ = Miracles happen.
| $s$ = Suffering exists.

First let us consider the views of the **atheist**.

$$P(G|s) = \dfrac{P(s|G)P(G)}{P(s)}$$

| $P(G)$ is the prior probability that the Christian God exists.
| $P(s)$ is the probability that suffering exists. The atheist thinks this is certain.
| $P(G|s)$ is the posterior probability that the Christian God exists, given suffering exists.
| $P(s|G)$ is the probability of suffering, given the Christian God exists, given suffering exists. The atheist thinks this is vanishingly small.

$$P(G|s) = \dfrac{0 \times P(G)}{1} = 0$$

The net result, for the atheist, is that $P(G|s) \rightarrow 0$.

The **theist** sees it the other way, looking at miracles instead of suffering.

$$P(G|m) = \dfrac{P(m|G)P(G)}{P(m)}$$

| $P(G)$ is the prior probability that the Christian God exists.
| $P(m)$ is the probability that miracles happen. The theist thinks this is certain.
| $P(G|m)$ is the posterior probability that the Christian God exists, given miracles happen.
| $P(m|G)$ is the probability of miracles, given the Christian God exists, given suffering exists. The theist thinks this is certain.

$$P(G|m) = \dfrac{1 \times P(G)}{1} = 1$$

The net result, for the theist, is that $P(G|s) \rightarrow 1$.

## Reportable Type Class in Haskell {#id0322050422}

[#haskell](#haskell)

I have an idea that each function, when called, should report its own calculations. Then we just append each line to the calc when the time comes to run it. Isn't this how the human engineer works? He (or she) works on a particular member design and does the calcs. I think this should use the `Show` class.

```haskell
instance Show Rectangle where
show (Rectangle h w) = "Rectangle with base " ++ show w ++ " and height " ++ show h

instance Show Circle where
show (Circle r) = "Circle with radius " ++ show r

## Architecture of C Version of Determine {#id2010080522}

#2010080522

[#programming](#programming) [#determine](#determine) [#antlr](#antlr)

The idea would be to use the following workflow to create the determine tool:

1. Write a grammar file defining the domain-specific language (DSL).
1. Use ANTLR to generate parser code.
1. Add code to react to events emitted by the parser.
1. Compile the code from the two preceeding steps to produce an executable.

Then we would use the determine tool like this:
1. Write an input file in accordance with the DSL grammar file.
1. Run the parser; each parser event emits Markdown into a file.
1. Use Pandoc to convert the (intermediate) Markdown file into the final PDF deliverable.

The idea of this zettel is that I could develop two independent tools that do the same thing in different ways and make sure the two give the same results.

This would assure quality by the assumption that the probability of both tools making the same error would be small. This would increase confidence that the final answer is correct. It's kind of duplicating the idea of an engineer and checker working together to ensure a quality project.

The tools are to convert domain-specific language input file into a Markdown file.

I had the vague idea to call them "Check-O-Matic" and "ReCheck-O-Matic" or something like that. This gives us the opportunity to use some fun-looking retro-futuristic graphics.

## Information Entropy {#id5908190622}

#5908190622

[#information](#information)

Entropy quantifies *similarities* and *differences*.

Imagine three bags of orange and blue marbles.

| Bag A has 9 orange and 1 blue marble.
| Bag B has 5 orange and 5 blue marbles.

Bag B has higher entropy than bag A. Why? Because if we pick an orange marble from bag A, it would not surprise us as much as picking an orange one from bag B. Picking the *blue* one from bag A would be a surprise, but *on average* over a large number of repetitions (with replacement) bag A would surprise us less than bag B.

So we can see surprise is (in some way) inversely related to probability. When the probability of an event $X$ is high, the surprise is low. When the probability of an event $Y$ is low, the surprise is high.

## Functional Breakdown {#id3020220622}

#3020220622

[#philosophy](#philosophy)

| Purpose - the "why"
| Function
| Process
| Activity
| Task

Each of these things must point to a future state. The reason to act at all is to move toward a future state. One reason for having sex is to achieve a state of pleasure for a period of time and relaxation afterward. Another reason for sex is to feel a special and unique closeness with another human being. You could say the desire pleasure and closeness are the "why" for sex. The function of sex is to satisfy the design for pleasure and closeness. The function of an action is its reason for existence.

The function of sex is to provide feelings of physical and psychological pleasure and emotional closeness. Insofar as it achieves these things, it is functional. If it is, say, done in an adulterous or deceptive way, it will probably instill feelings of regret and self-disapproval which are undesirable states. They are not states we would rationally set out to achieve. So when we act in a way that results in feelings of regret and self-disapproval, we have acted against reason. We have acted irrationally, which is to say harmfully. We want our acts to help, not harm. The reason to do something is to help someone, often yourself. We can say, then, that adultery is dis-functional. It brings about undesired results.

All this is a very clinical way of saying that sex is good and even beautiful and meaningful when it is done in a loving, mutually respectful relationship. So sex is *conditionally* functional. It can be disfunctional under other conditions, for example if it is coercive.

## Conditionally Functional {#id4320220622}

#4320220622

[#psychology](#psychology) [#philosophy](#philosophy)

An act is *conditionally* functional or disfunctional. This means a particular act is only judged functional if certain circumstances are present when it is performed. Those circumstances may not occur every time, so the act may end up disfunctional on some attempts. Wisdom would mean learning how to improve the ratio of functional to disfunctional acts. We want the proportion of our acts to be functional and increase that proportion over time. That is how we improve ourselves morally. We keep doing the right thing until we get really good at it. We also make course corrections by examining disfunctional acts and trying to lessen their frequency in the pool of all acts we perform over a period of time.

An act is wrong when it is performed when circumstances make it disfunctional.

The sure sign of a wrong act is that it is disfunctional. It may be hard to spot when it is disfunctional. We may be deluded into thinking it is functional when it is not. We may not be aware of the outcome of the act. Motivation seems to matter. The sincerely held desire and intention to perform functional acts seems praiseworthy without needing to be justified.

A process is a set of tasks. A task is performed by one role.

**STEP 1**: How am I disfunctionally feeling and acting if I let this push my buttons?

**STEP 2**: What am I irrationally thinking to make myself excessively anxious, angry, guilty, depressed, or wanting to act disfunctionally?

**STEP 2A**: What am I irrationally thinking about myself?

**STEP 2B**: What am I irrationally thinking about the other(s)?

**STEP 2C**: What am I irrationally thinking about the situation?

**STEP 3**: How can I challenge my irrational thinking? (This involves asking challenging questions that demand proof for irrational propositions)

**STEP 4**: What realistic preferences can I substitute for my irrational thinking?

## Musings on Purpose and Meaning {#id2319280622}

#2319280622

[#rebt](#rebt) [#philosophy](#philosophy) [#psychology](#psychology)

We want a purpose that does not make us inferior to anyone or anything else.

Life is its own purpose. If it was for something else, you are subordinating your happiness to something else.

Life is its own purpose. If it was for something else, you are saying that you are inferior something else.

You are the most important thing in the world to you. That's why being you is your purpose in life. Otherwise, if you made something else the purpose, you would be saying that it is more important than you. That's logically impossible.

You are alive right now. And you ask, "What is the purpose of my life?" No matter what answer you give to that question, you assuredly must remain alive to fulfill that purpose. That's logically inescapable. And a posthumous success does not change the logic. You still have to be alive to play the part you actually played, even if it culminates in something happening after you die. Even if you choose to sacrifice your own life, both the moment of that decision and the moment of the act of sacrifice must happen while you are breathing. So there is a super-purpose if you will. That is to be you, to be alive, to live your life. No other purpose can supersede it, because every other purpose, including selfless purposes, requires you to be alive.

- Why stay alive? Because it's fun. Because it *can* be fun.
- Why stay alive? Because what an opportunity!
- Why stay alive? It is beautiful and sweet and sad.
- Why stay alive? Love.

Why stay alive? To answer the question, "Why stay alive?" I can never answer it if I am not alive. I am more likely to answer it if I am also healthy. So I make health and happiness my first two goals and answering the question, "What is the meaning of life?" as the third. And I can acknowledge that no matter what the answer ends up being, I will get to the answer faster, better, and with more happiness if I am healthy emotionally and physically. I will push my ass to get healthy and use my added power to understand the deeper meaning of life.

Wanting to find an answer to the question, "What is the meaning of life?" is enough to bootstrap your worldview, because it implies that you must go on living and implies that you should put forth effort to improve yourself. Improvement means getting better at solving problems, including an existential crisis.

Principles:
1. Staying alive is required.
1. Being happy is better than being unhappy.
1. Love is the most important thing for happiness.
1. Being creative increases happiness.
1. Being in nature increases happiness.
1. Setting and achieving goals increases happiness.
1. Having more freedom is better than having less freedom.

This is what I have so far, in order of highest to lowest priority:

1. **Staying alive is your first goal** - You're already doing this, and you know you cannot do much once you're dead, so no matter what you decide is the meaning of life, you have to be alive to experience it. So "stay alive" is the first goal.
1. **Work is your second goal** - You're already doing this one. It is also necessary, because it is mandatory to work to achieve any goal, and you -- by definition -- have a goal already: to stay alive. So you cannot get out of this one. But why leave it at that?
1. **Make it your goal to increase happiness and decrease unhappiness** - This one is a choice. It is not made mandatory because of your continued existence goal and the nature of goals, that they require work to achieve. You can choose to make it your goal, and it seems to me on its face to be a good choice.
1. **Make self-improvement a goal** - We define self-improvement as increasing your abilities that contribute to goal-achievement. Because of Goal 3, we want to increase happiness, so it follows logically that we would be better off also getting better at completing objectives. Why? Achieving goals increases happiness in human beings.
1. **Use your free will to choose the next goal** - After you have committed to all of the above, you can choose whatever goals you want! What a beautiful thought. You have turned yourself into a living, self-improving, goal-seeking machine, and you cannot do better than that. You can go conquer the world, create a world, or create yourself in the world. Use this power to create.

Happiness is not a goal but an outcome of the above.

## Zettel Numbering Revisited {#id4006290622}

#4006290622

[#zettelkasten](#zettelkasten) [#writing](#writing)

I am wondering if my current ten-digit quasi-backwards dating system is best for my zettels. I say that because ten digits is a lot. They are not convenient. What I like about them is that they are guaranteed unique. Maybe I could shorten them to a system that is more sensible by reducing it to something like one of these candidates.

### Candidate 1 - YYMMDDNN

This candidate would start with the current date. Today, for example, is June 29, 2022. So the start of the zettel ID would be 220628. The rest of it is simply an index starting with 1 ("natural numbers").

This way, each day when I write zettels, I can quickly jot down the date and nothing more. Then when I get a quiet time, I can arrange the various cards together and assign their index numbers.

| 220628 - 1st zettle of the day.
| 220628 - 2nd zettle of the day.
| 220628 - 3rd zettle of the day.
| 220628 - 4th zettle of the day.

After reflecting, I can number them.

| 22062801 - 1st zettle of the day.
| 22062802 - 2nd zettle of the day.
| 22062803 - 3rd zettle of the day.
| 22062804 - 4th zettle of the day.

### Candidate 2 - MMDDNNN

This is the same as Candidate 2, except that I would remove the year. The benefit would be to shorten even more the number. The downside is that I would have to have access to my entire collection to ensure that I am not duplicating an index number. Now I would make the index 3-digits to give me 999 possible cards per day over my lifetime.

| 0628 - 1st zettle of the day.
| 0628 - 2nd zettle of the day.
| 0628 - 3rd zettle of the day.
| 0628 - 4th zettle of the day.

After reflecting, I can number them.

| 0628001 - 1st zettle of the day.
| 0628002 - 2nd zettle of the day.
| 0628003 - 3rd zettle of the day.
| 0628004 - 4th zettle of the day.

## Physical Zettels Idea {#id51190110722}

#51190110722

[#zettelkasten](#zettelkasten) [#organization](#organization)

This is a new idea to use either 3x5 or 4x6 index cards to create a physical zettelkasten system.

### Numbering

Index numbers are the **natural numbers** ("counting numbers"): $i \in \mathbb{N}$. These are appended after the category keyword and the octothorpe.

| Format: `<Keyword> #<index>`
| Example: `Idea #1`

A second level of index numbers would be by alphabetical letter. This would be used for sub-goals, for example:

| Format: `[1-9][0-9]*[A-Z]*`
| Example: `Goal 24A`

### Category Keywords

I'm not sure about all these, so I may revise it later.

- **Idea** - Used to record quick ideas that I don't want to categorize.
- **Goal** - This is an important one to capture goals and sub-goals. Each goal card describes a state of affairs that one desires to achieve. You can include comments and data such as the names of people who can help you and the due date.
- **Claim** - Used for philosophical or factual claims about the universe. Each claim is able to be evaluated as either **true** or **false**. *Proposition* is a synonym for claim.
- **Value** - Like a goal, but something that is not objectively verifiable. A value might be something like, "Being a good father." It is not clearly defined. It might be fun to link goals and values.
- **Project** - What if we said a project is a name given to a set of goals? You can list the goals on the project card, along with comments and data. A project is considered *complete* when each of its goals have been met (achieved).
- **Event** - This documents a factual event. It could be used to record decision, for example.

## REBT as a Philosophy of Life {#id3820140722}

#3820140722

[#rebt](#rebt) [#psychology](#psychology)

Source: <https://rebtdoctor.com/24-rebt-as-a-philosophy-of-life.html>

REBT is a philosophically based psychotherapy. In my view, it is more than an evidence-based approach to psychotherapy. It is an outlook on life. Said another way, REBT is a philosophy of life aimed at facilitating psychological health, resilience, happiness, and meaning in life. As a philosophy of life, it suggests that you integrate these healthy elements into your approach to life:

1. **Self-interest** - A healthy approach to life is to put oneself first, guiltlessly and shamelessly, while holding others a close second (not a distant second). Doing so does not mean that one must always put themselves first. It merely means they can do so when the matter is of sufficient importance to them and then proceeds with due ethical regard for others. This is enlightened self-interest not selfishness.

2. **Social interest** - A healthy approach to life is to consider the impact of your behavior on others. Because we live in a social world, it is in your long-term best interest to consider others' feelings, goals, and rights while not holding yourself responsible for managing others' emotions or their lives. Instead, strive to model emotional responsibility for others to witness so that they, too, learn how to take care of themselves and be responsible for and manage their emotional reactions in a challenging world.

3. **Self-direction, independent thought, and personal responsibility** - A healthy approach to life is to consider the advice and teaching of informed others, but in the end, dare to engage in independent thinking, make your own decisions, and remain fully responsible for the consequences of these decisions. Remember, no one has as much invested in your well-being and happiness as you. Take full responsibility for creating the life you wish to have.

4. **High frustration tolerance / high discomfort tolerance** - A healthy approach to life is cultivating patience for frustrating circumstances, internal states of discomfort, and inconvenience to achieve long-term goals and maximize your overall happiness and meaning. It is healthy to accept that work and practice are how skills are acquired and mastered, even if the process is slow and frustrating.

5. **Flexibility** - A healthy approach to life is to hold flexible and non-extreme attitudes leading to flexible and adaptive behavior. Avoid making rigid rules for yourself and others. Psychological flexibility enables you to adapt to people and living conditions that you find challenging and to remain broad-minded in your views.

6. **Acceptance of uncertainty** - A healthy approach to life is to recognize you live in a world of probability where absolute certainty and guarantees do not exist. Teach yourself to tolerate basing decisions and actions on estimations of probability. Remain open to the unknown and new discovery.

7. **Commitment to creative, vitally absorbing pursuits** – A healthy approach to searching for personal happiness and meaning is to have self-selected goals that interest you and then actively pursue them. This creative involvement stems from a healthy sense of curiosity. Strive to maintain this creative involvement over the course of your entire life.

8. **Scientific thinking** - A healthy approach to life is to strive to think logically, reason correctly, and use scientific reasoning to falsify hypotheses to understand how life itself works. Scientific thought is a tool for problem-solving and achieving one's goals.

9. **Unconditional Self-Acceptance** - A healthy approach to life is to strive to accept yourself unconditionally while appreciating that you are a fallible human. Discipline your mind to evaluate your many parts, especially your behavior in the context of your goals. Avoid attempting to measure your human value or downing or condemning yourself when your actions fall short of your standards. Strive to abolish your ego. Stick to rating aspects of you which you wish to improve upon.

10. **Unconditional Other-Acceptance** - A healthy approach to life aims to unconditionally accept other people while viewing all people as fallible humans or born mistake-makers. REBT philosophy acknowledges that it is often helpful to rate and value other people's behaviors. It recognizes that the individual is responsible for their actions but avoids a global judgment of the other person's human value, whose conduct is the evaluation's focus. REBT philosophy holds that all standards for rating people as people are arbitrary, and therefore human worth cannot be objectively defined and determined. REBT philosophy views all people as highly complex beings and continuously evolving ones, making rating people invalid.

11. **Unconditional Life-Acceptance** – A healthy approach to life is to avoid overgeneralizations about the whole of life. View life as having both good times and bad times. Accept both ends of this continuum, avoid the attitude that life should always be comfortable and without difficulty, and strive to enjoy life as fully as possible despite the inevitable hassles, sorrows, losses, and burdens of the human condition.

12. **Calculated risk-taking** - A healthy approach to life is accepting life's uncertainty. Cultivate the capacity to take calculated risks to maximize your pleasure in life and achieve self-selected goals. Take these risks with the appreciation of the possible benefits and potential losses that may ensue. When risking taking fails to achieve the desired outcome, rely upon your unconditional self-acceptance, unconditional life-acceptance, and your ability to manage your emotional reactions and tolerate the consequences of your failed actions.

13. **Long-range hedonism** - A healthy approach to life is to view it as an opportunity to enjoy oneself rather than as a test to prove oneself. Therefore, it is crucial to maximizing pleasure by living for both the short and the long run and cultivating the ability to delay immediate gratification and exercise sufficiently high frustration and discomfort tolerance to achieve self-selected long-term hedonistic goals.

14. **Nonutopianism and nonperfectionism** - A healthy approach to life is accepting utopias and perfect conditions, and things do not exist. It is good to choose not to disturb yourself over the imperfection you encounter while striving to improve things to maximize enjoyment. It is essential to accept that it is impossible to achieve a state of perfection and far better to make improvements where possible. Perfect happiness and meaning in life may be unattainable, but greater life satisfaction may very well be achievable with reflection and effort.

15. **Self-responsibility for your emotional disturbance** - A healthy approach to life involves acknowledging that life's adversities and other people's misbehavior contribute to your feelings but do not determine your emotional upsetness. It is beneficial to appreciate that your rigid and extreme attitudes, which you construct and choose to hold about life's adversities, lie at the base of emotional disturbance. As a result of this acceptance of emotional responsibility, it is healthy to strive to develop adaptive, flexible, and realistic attitudes that enable you to function in a challenging, imperfect world full of fallible humans.

16. **Healthy sense of humor** - A healthy approach to life is to maintain a healthy sense of humor by not taking yourself, others, the world, or life itself too seriously nor without sufficient concern. It is best to feel concerned, not anxious, and not cross the line into over-seriousness associated with emotional disturbance.

17. **Semantic precision** - A healthy approach to life involves striving to think in a semantically precise way. Instead of engaging in overgeneralized thinking such as "I always fail" or "Everything is bad," it is better to acknowledge that you have failed in a particular endeavor or that conditions are bad but avoid an overstated description of reality. Likewise, other examples of semantic precision are thoughts and statements like "You have misbehaved this time, but you are not a bad person" and "life has many difficulties, but it is not always difficult." Semantic precision in thought and language allows for more accurate internal representations of reality and greater emotional well-being. It is healthy to monitor your thinking and correct any instances of sloppy, imprecise thinking in the face of adversity to re-establish healthier emotional and behavioral reactions. It is good to strive to discipline your thinking to be precise and scientific, which will help your effort to adapt to challenging conditions.

18. **Efficient use of time** – A healthy approach to life appreciates the precious resource of time. Healthy living involves having priorities, accepting that time is limited, and committing to efficiently using this resource to maximize life satisfaction and meaning.

19. **Maintenance of physical health** – A healthy approach to life involves appreciating your physical limitations and the importance of maintaining your body as well as your mind. Avoid all work and no play. Make time for maintaining your physical health through a healthy eating regimen, sufficient exercise and sleep.

20. **Acceptance of death and the process of dying** - A healthy approach to life is to accept the prospect of your death, the death of loved ones, and the process of dying. Appreciate that death is always a distinct possibility, with its hour being the unknown. Strive to lead a meaningful and satisfying life free of unhealthy negative emotions towards life's finiteness and the process of dying.

An **idea** becomes one of the other things. The "Idea" bucket is a buffer for thoughts. They can be reviewed and promoted into one of the other categories.

Each **meta** zettel in the "Meta" bucket describes the zettelkasten system itself.

A **goal** is a set of **objectives** achieved using a set of **processes** to uphold **values** in pursuit of a **vision**.
