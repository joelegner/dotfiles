# In the Beginning 

> In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God.

`logos.txt` is a special text file with everything I know. I created it on September 14, 2022 at 12:21 pm in Valrico, Florida.

Gave up on Debian AMD 64.  Installed 32-bit Etch (testing) system.  Detected
SATA drive, but I chose to install on 80GB IDE drive.  I want to keep things
simple!
    
## 2006-03-21

Installed phpMyAdmin.

Copied Building from leg to legner1 and started phpBEARS project.

Installed nVidia driver from apt.  This resulted in much less flicker than the
default Vesa driver.  Note that the driver is listed as nvidia in
``/etc/X11/xorg.conf``, not nv.

Source files should rightly go under ``/usr/src``

To stop xserver, use ``/etc/init.d/gdm stop``
To start it, user ``/etc/init.d/gdm start``

In KDE, ALT-F2 brings up a run window.

To rename all files and folders recursively to lowercase::
   $ find * -exec rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' "{}" \;

To merge PDF files use the pdfjoin command.  See man pdfjoin.

## 2006-03-22

Started phpBEARS project on new machine (legner1).  So far all I have done is
copy the original Building project from leg to ``/var/www/phpbears`` and resumed
working on the planning documents.  I slightly reorganized the planning
documents to make them more streamlined.

## 2006-03-23

To make a recursive, incremental backup with rsync::

   rsync -a --delete -u -R source/ dest/

where ``source/`` and ``dest/`` are the directory paths.  For example::

   rsync -a --delete -u -R /home/legnerjm/ /home/legner1/backups/

Got GD to work with PHP (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.image.php)::

   apt-get install php5-gd.
   apache2 -k stop
   apache2 -k start

Julie put a notice on Freecycle for our cat, "Josey," and someone came and
picked her up today.  She had been living in the storage room which was not a
good place for her.  She will be better off now on a farm in Clinton, Illinois.

Added functionality to chcase to replace spaces with underscore characters.
Now use: ``chcase -r -d -s *``

Finally found a good script to change the case of file and directory names: chcase from http://www.blemished.net/chcase

2013-01-10 now located here: http://chcase.sourceforge.net/

To rename files and sub-directories::

   chcase -r -d *

Using the 32-bit Debian has been a godsend.  I even have OpenOffice 2.0
working - I couldn't get ANY version of OOo to work on AMD64!  I will probably
give it a shot in a year or two.

Revised backup script to keep a rotating daily backup named
``/home/legner1/backups/daily/0-Sun, 1-Mon, ..., 6-Sat``.  This is only for
``legeng``, ``legnerjm``, and ``/var/www directories``.

The daily backup script is ``/root/scripts/backup-daily.sh``.  Also made
``backup-weekly.sh`` that runs on Friday 7:00 pm (cron).

## 2006-03-25

We took Joey to Chuck E. Cheese for food and playtime tonight.

Happy day as we cleaned out the storage room; it was filthy due to the
occupancy of the cat.  I vacuumed and then mopped the floor with a bleach
solution.

We ate dinner at Alexander's Steakhouse, and it was not very good.

Installed wxPython and tried it.  Looks really promising.  Maybe so-long
to C++ and friends!

Installed Vim and tried it out.  It may become my new text editor.

The computer guy called and said the motherboard burned out.  It is under
warranty.  This time they are putting a different motherboard in it, because
they have been having problems with the one they used originally.

In Python, a class can have attributes and an instance of a class can have
attributes as well.  Class attributes are shared among all instances of a
class, while instance attributes are not.  The best place to create instance
attributes is in an __init__ function.  See:
http://www.zephyrfalcon.org/labs/python_pitfalls.html

Bought a book Python Pocket Reference at Borders.

Got legner1 back from the shop.  They took out the old motherboard and put a
new one in.  The tech said he got a grub error, but when I got it home it
loaded right up (knock on wood).

Today is my 33rd birthday!  We ate lunch at Buffalo Wild Wings, and they gave
me a piece of chocolate cake, which Joey helped eat.  Julie gave me an mp3
player.  When we got home, she baked a cake, and Joey helped decorate it.  I
made steaks and chicken on the grill.

## 2006-04-04

Primed new guitar pedal board.

Put apt-get update; apt-get upgrade; apt-get clean in a new maint.sh file which
is called by backup-daily.sh (all under /root/scripts/).

Installed package exuberant-ctags.  Use ctags [source files] to generate a tags
file in a source directory.  Then in GVIM, use these commands to jump to tags
(http://ctags.sourceforge.net/):

   :ta tag			Find a tag.
   Ctrl-]			Find the tag under the cursor.
   Ctrl-T			Return to previous location before jump to tag.

The higher the risk, the higher the compensation.

If you save the owner money or time, you should be compensated.

For consulting engineers, the term "brand" means the feeling a client gets when
interacting with the engineer.

Consulting engineering has a low margin.  Typically across the industry the
profit margin is about 6%, meaning for every $1.00 of revenue, a typical firm
has $0.94 of expenses.  For a low margin business, a small increase in revenue
greatly increases profit.

For example, suppose you increase your gross revenue by 1% to $1.01.  Then
your profit increases (1.01 - 0.94)/(1.00 - 0.94) = 16 2/3%

Most industries do not base their price on the cost of production like
consulting engineers do.  They segment their markets.

A deterministic system has no randomness.  In the computer science sense, it
means for a given input, the output will always be the same.  This contrasts
with probabilistic.

In a probibilistic system, the outcome depends upon a random factor such that,
for a given input, the output will not always be the same.  An example of this
is a Monte Carlo simulation.  Such a system is also called non-deterministic or
stochastic.

   >>> x = copy.copy(y)        # make a shallow copy of y
   >>> x = copy.deepcopy(y)    # make a deep copy of y

For an object with references to other objects: copy() - inserts the same
references into the copy.  deepcopy() - copies the nested objects recursively.

Program components:

   Input - data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.

   Output - show data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.

   Math - Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
   multiplication.

   Conditional Execution - if-then logic

   Repetition - loops

   Program errors:

      Syntax - code violates the rules for the language: x = (4 - 1x]

      Runtime - exceptions occur while program is executing.

      Semantic - program does not do what it is intended to do.

Suppose you have::

   >>> def twice(x):
   >>>     return x*2
   >>> twice(3)
   6

The number 3 is an argument, and the variable x is a parameter.  When the
function is called twice(3), the argument 3 is assigned to the parameter x.

A state diagram shows the value assigned to each variable.  A stack diagram is
a series of state diagrams, one for each scope.

State diagram::

   +------------+
   | a -> 4.5   |
   | b -> "Joe" |
   +------------+

Stack diagram::

    __init__    +------------+
                | a -> 4.5   |
                | b -> "Joe" |
                +------------+

    twice       +------------+
                | x -> 3     |
                +------------+

In Python, strings are immutable.

Slices in Python::

    >>> x = "Monte Python"
    >>> x[0:4]
    'Mont'

Why?  Imagine the indices refer to lines between characters::

    |M|o|n|t|e| |P|y|t|h|o|n
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011

Then the slice is from 0 to 4::

    |M|o|n|t|
    0 1 2 3 4

Collection types in Python:

   list: mutable, enclosed in brackets []

   tuple: immutable, enclosed in parenthesis ()

   dictionary: mutable, enclosed in braces {}.  A dictionary can use any
   immutable type as its index.

Aliasing means assigning two names to the same object.  If they refer to a
mutable object, assigning the copy a new value will change the original.  For
example::

    >>> x = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> y = x
    >>> y[0] = 3
    >>> print x
    [3, 5, 6]

Here x and y are both aliases for the list [4, 5, 6] which is later [3, 5, 6].

Solved NVIDIA crisis:

Install Kernel Source

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install linux-source-2.6.27 - replace 2.6.17 with your kernel
   $ version ('uname -a' or 'uname -r')
   $ cd /usr/src
   $ tar -jxvf linux-source-2.6.17
   $ ln -s linux-source-2.6.12 linux

Install Kernel Headers

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.17-2

Install nVidia Drivers

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-9629-pkg1.run

Finally, Reboot to get back into X.

Went to NVIDIA website and downloaded most recent driver for Linux.  Needed
kernel sources, so I installed linux-source-2.6.17.

After a recent update, X.org is slow.  It takes up a lot of CPU when
scrolling.  Firefox is basically unusable now because of the slow scrolling.

In /var/log/Xorg.0.log, there is a mysterious error message:
``(EE) AIGLX: Screen 0 is not DRI capable``

I believe my video card is a NVIDIA GeForce 6100

Later, but appears to be unrelated:
``(EE) Error loading keymap /var/lib/xkb/server-0.xkm``

Tried to resolve X.org problem by dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and switching
from vesa to nv.  Did not work

To compute how many games back a team is from another:
[(fewer wins) + (extra losses)]/2

Or, if team 1 has W1 wins and L1 losses, team 2 has W2 wins and L2
losses, and team 1 is ahead of team 2, then team 2 is the following
number of games behind:

[(W1 - W2) + (L2 - L1)]/2

So the Cubs at 53-46 are behind the Brewers at 56-46:

[(56 - 53) + (46 - 46)]/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 games.

Set up rsync to work over ssh to transfer files from legner1 to phpwebhosting
for offsite storage.

To use without entering a password each time:

As legnerjm on legner1:

1.  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa::

      Generating public/private rsa key pair.
      Enter file in which to save the key (/home/legnerjm/.ssh/id_rsa):
      Created directory '/home/legnerjm/.ssh'.
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
      Enter same passphrase again:
      Your identification has been saved in /home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa.
      Your public key has been saved in /home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

The key fingerprint is::

      31:df:a5:73:4a:2f:a6:6c:1c:32:a2:f2:b3:c5:a7:1f legnerjm@legner1

2.  Login to remote computer (ash.phpwebhosting.com) as legner and create the
    .ssh directory::

      $ ssh -l legner ash.phpwebhosting.com mkdir -p .ssh
      legner@ash.phpwebhosting.com's password:

3.  Copy the legnerjm public key to legner@ash.phpwebhosting.com .ssh folder
    into authentication_hosts file. And, type the password again for the last
    time, hopefully::

      $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -l legner ash.phpwebhosting.com 
      >'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
      legner@ash.phpwebhosting.com's password


4.  ssh to ash.phpwebhosting.com and then::

Something is true iff:

1. It is supported by two good sources.

2. It is not contracticted by a good source.

Sources are good iff:

1. They are independent.

2. They have no discernable conflict of interest (no reason to lie).

3. Their results are repeatable (tough for history).

A fact is something that has really occurred or is the case.

Friday - Renee B. came to our house for dinner.  Her girlfriend Kristy is up
north helping her dad do a construction project, and will be out of town until
after Christmas.  We had smoked salmon.  Renee brought an artichoke dip.  She
also brought her dog, "Brody" who is a 2 year old yellow lab they spent $1500
on.

Renee told a story about confronting car thieves that had stolen and totaled
Kristy's truck on the south side of St. Pete.  She confronted them with a golf

Saturday night and we played music at Casey's Pub in St. Pete.  This was our
first electric Wonder Twins gig in Florida.  Charlie Nichol sat in on guitar
and bass.  Paul Caruthers also played bass, and a guy named Joey played the
drums.  Julie and I both liked Joey.

Joey is from Kentucky and is involved in conveyor components through his
father.  They may manufacture some or at least sell them.  He is 27 and claims
to have been a touring musician.  He currently has no drum set.  He was with
his neighbor, Elena, who was overtly romantically interested in Joey.

Paul and Peggy came by but it was after we already played.

David from DcR came with his Girlfriend  and her brother and another female
friend.

We stopped at 7-11 on MLK in St. Pete and went over west of MLK around 38th Ave
North.  On the way back, Julie dropped me off at the wine bar where Renee works
since I had promised to stop in on Sunday night.

While I was there, a woman named Ingrid bought me 2 beers. Ingrid is a
(lesbian?) pharmacist at Publix in NE Shopping Center, 200 37th Ave NE, St.
Petersburg. Renee said she was a regular, which she denied. We joked about
hemorrhoids. Drank Belgian beer.  Ingrid sneakily bought my drinks and then

Receive $300 from Terry and $250 from Bob for Christmas. Bob also sent $20 each
for the boys. We are considering a TRS rollover.

I ate leftover ribs from Lucky B's for lunch.

We had shrimp and couscous for supper.

Julie mailed gifts to IL $53 shipping.

Started reading Getting Things Done by David Allen.

## 2011-12-20

Worked at DcR on the rail pit for project 3738.  Read some of Getting Things
Done (GTD).

At 6:30 pm Julie went to Wine Madonna with Jennifer Caruthers for wine
tasting.  We are planning the upcoming holiday weekend.  I ran 2.13 miles in
19:54.

Moved GTD information into a Getting Things Done summary note as it was
cluttering my journal notes.

I have been listening to an audio book: The History of Western Philosophy by
Bertrand Russell.  So far all he has discussed are the Greeks.  It is very
interesting.  I like thinking about duality such as mind and body or empirical
versus rational.

## 2011-12-24

Paul Caruthers, Laurie S. and Renee B. came over and had dinner with us.  We
had hamburgers and chicken on the grill.  Laurie brought bakery buns and a
pecan pie that we never did eat.

Paul C. and I drank beer while the girls drank wine.  They teased Paul about
the beer drinking as it was said to be uncharacteristic of his habits.

At around 10 pm EST we attended a Skype call with Julie's extended family up
north and saw Terry, Scott, Jennifer, Kelli, Grandma McCoy, Doug, Bob, Bob's
girls, Mike and Kathy and their daughter.  The call only lasted about 15
minutes.

The kids were unusually gung-ho about going to bed on account of Santa's
imminent arrival.

## 2011-12-25

The kids woke us up at 5:09 am! I was able to hold out until 7:30 with the gift
unwrapping.  They kept coming in the room between those times, and Julie gave
them their stockings to pacify them.

The boys got lots of toys.  Joey got several Lego Harry Potter sets, and Tommy
got some Imaginext sets including a huge Batman bat cave set.

Julie gave me underwear, a Tee shirt with a sound level meter thing that really
works and Step Brothers on DVD.  She also gave me a case of special seasonal
Heineken beers.

I gave Julie a last-minute gift of a $50 spa gift certificate which I was able
to scratch together using my Legner Engineering business account.

The Bears played the Packers and lost 35-21 so they are eliminated from the
playoffs.  The Packers have home field advantage throughout.

In the late afternoon Paul Caruthers came over and then Paul Dengler and Peggy
Johnston came too.  We had a dinner of glazed spiral sliced ham, sweet
potatoes, broccoli and sweet peas and rolls.  Paul C. left early due to work on
Monday.  Paul and Peggy stayed a little later, and we enjoyed a fire pit and
roasted marshmallows.

A cat belonging to the neighbors to the north was on our boat lift and fell
into the water trying to jump to the dock.  It climbed up our mangrove tree and
escaped over the fence.  Julie checked with the neighbors and they said the cat
was home.

## 2011-12-26

DcR office closed today.

Spent day with the kids and Julie.  We took them to Toys R Us to attempt to
spend their gift cards from Uncle Ron, but the shelves were practically bare,
especially in the Lego area.  No bikes at all on the shelves either.

Ran 2 miles, but it was hard.

## 2011-12-27

Worked at DcR.  3738 Rail Load Out concrete pit design.  Wall reinf and
slab reinf.  Did some of the drafting of the drawings.  10 hours because
not sure about this coming week's holiday pay.

Created prelim Technipower time tickets and sent to Christy L. for review.
The previous week, this week and next week are confusing given the variety
of Technipower holiday dates and DcR office closure dates.

Julie and I are planning to go to St. Pete First Night on the 31st, and we
need tickets, but money is very tight right now.

I am pretty well now using the GTD system at work.  At home I am still
trying to get the first In Box cleared out.

Carmen Jordan asked for a fee proposal for aluminum railings, which I gave
to him via e-mail.  He wanted me to just seal and sign a simple drawing
provided by another, but it was lacking too much info.  I fear he did not
budget the $400 I requested.

Russ Arbuckle said he would send me a check.  Not sure if he did or not.
We need $400 to pay our upcoming health insurance.

Discovered Tommy again has pin worms.  Perhaps the whole family does.  Julie to
call a doc tomorrow.

## 2011-12-28

Worked at DcR.
   3738 Rail Load Out concrete pit design.
   Drawing markups.
   Beam pocket coordination.
   Worked 10 hours for 2nd day.  Tomorrow also 10.
   Per agreement with Frank Pirillo, will work 10 + 10 + 10 + 6  = 36
   hours but
   record 10 + 9 + 9 + 8 = 36 hours

Found out I had never paid the $107 to get my Massachusetts license.  Did so
today.

Answered a question from Darrell Stoller with Premier on 471 Brayton Point and
also was assured by him I will be getting 2 outstanding invoices paid.

Doctor said he will write a prescription for Tommy but not for the entire
family for the pin worms.  The other 3 of us will take an over-the-counter
remedy.  Need to clean the house, replace sheets, etc.

Designed an aluminum railing for Carmen Jordan.  Project No. 526.  Sent him
prelim drawings. He then asked me if he could pick them up in the morning, and
I said yes, so I stayed up until 11:12 pm doing so.

Darrell Stoller with Premier Fabrication sent me a small project to quote.
Wrote him that I would get back to him tomorrow 2011-12-29.

Re-programmed sprinklers at 4127 Coquina Key Dr SE to come on only 1 day a
week: Wednesday.

We had Chinese food for supper including, what else, Crab Rangoon!

## 2011-12-29

Worked at DcR.

Left drawings in mail slot for Carmen Jordan. He left me a check for $400.

Looked at a grain dryer support structure for Darrell Stoller with Premier
Fabrication.  He sent me a couple emails with additional info I need to check
out.

Wrote a preliminary set list for the Jan 21 gig at Casey's Pub and points
beyond with the recently electrified band.  We are going to need a website and
to settle on a name.

## 2011-12-31

We took a taxicab to downtown St. Petersburg for First Night with the kids,
bringing their red wagon in the trunk of the cab.  Several friends attended:
Kristy & Renee and Paul and Jennifer Caruthers.  We ate at a British pub called
Moon Under Water.  I had a chicken pot pie.  We saw fireworks at 9 pm.

Walked with kids to Renee's wine-tasting bar and sat on the balcony to
chit-chat until after midnight.  The kids fell asleep, and we took a cab home
safely.

Discussed with Frank my concerns about CAD guy making more money than me. I
said it does not seem right considering the much higher risk and effort it
takes to run a project instead of just doing CAD.  Other highlights:

- DcR would pay for some 3D CAD training for me if works with schedule.

- My salary is in line with the other engineers in my department

- The current high CAD salary is an anomaly due to a 2nd offer

Yvonne came for a visit. Julie and she want shopping, then we ate out.

Since there was nothing else to do, I asked my boss, Frank, if I could take
the week off since we had been wanting to go to Disney World for some time but
had not set a date.  With the kids being homeschooled and the weather
perfect for January, this turned out to be an opportune time.  He granted my
vacation.  Wouldn't you know it but within an hour the information arrived in
my email.  We kept going to Disney anyway.

We arrived at Disney and bought premium annual passes plus a week in their
Beach Club resort where Julie and I had stayed with her parents many years ago.
We walked into the International Gate of Epcot and had a gay time.

Gave blood at Quest Diagnostics for a battery of tests ordered by my
gastroenterologist, Dr. Qazi.   They took 4 large vials and a smaller one.

Woke up at 3 am.  Felt pain in my anal area, so I tried to apply some
Preparation-H.  There seemed to be a small mass or something in there and below
it an area painful to the touch.  The mass does not seem to be connected
physically to the underlying tender structure which seems large and could be a
muscle or tendon. Naturally at that early hour my mind thought the worst, so I
looked up anal cancer, knowing one of its outcomes - a colostomy - is one of my
worst fears.  Anyway, I ended up staying up the rest of the night reading and
worrying.  Here is what I found:

Anal Cancer
   Extremely rare among white males my age: 0.005% chance (about 5 per 100,000)
   of developing by age 40.  This would account best for the slow development
   of the pain and possibly the presence of a lump (tumor).  However, it does
   not seem to account for my bowel problems and seems to not have developed
   quickly enough to be cancer.  Besides, its probability is so low.  I will
   still mention it to my new primary care doctor on Friday during my physical

Abscess
   These are common and would explain the tender area.  The mass would be
   unexplained.  It was difficult to find the second time, but I did find it.
   It's hard to tell if the mass is painful or the larger underlying
   structure.  I think it's the underlying structure.  If it was an abscess,
   the underlying thing I felt is likely an inflamed area around the abscess.
   The contradictory evidence for an abscess is the long-term development and
   sustained pain I have experienced.  Treatment would be by draining it.

Crohn's Disease
   This is a good possibility, because it could simultaneously explain my bowel
   symptoms as well as the pain and itching in the anal area.  It is probably
   much more prevalent than anal cancer, on the order of 5-50 per 100,000.
   Here is a list of symptoms:

      Symptoms include persistent diarrhea (loose, watery, or frequent bowel
      movements), cramping abdominal pain, fever, and, at times, rectal
      bleeding. Loss of appetite and weight loss also may occur.

      Insidious onset - yes

      Inflammation of the eyes - no

      Inflammation of the skin - yes?  Face gets ruddy patches.

      Inflammation of the joints - no

   Of these, the loose bowel movements and cramping fit my symptoms.  It is
   also known to commonly affect the anal region.  It can cause mouth sores
   that don't heal, which happened to me some months back.  I was worried the
   sores would never heal.

The hippocampus (sea horse) is part of the human brain which deals with memory,
especially storing and retrieving declarative memories.  Those are memories
which can be expressed in words.  It might be a more poetic name for my
knowledgebase (KB) project.  Seahorse seems cleaner.  The reason is that the KB
project kind of functions in the same way, recording my declarative memories.
They HAVE to be declarative, because they are primarily in the form of words.

Julie bought me a blood pressure monitor from Walgreens at my request.  I
started around noon to measure my blood pressure.  I created a Google drive
spreadsheet called Health Journal which calculates the average BP from all my
entries.  As of the end of the day 2013-02-20, my average BP is 146/87 and my
average pulse is 72.  

The American Heart Association http://www.heart.org says of my readings:

   Systolic: 140 < 146 < 159 = Stage 1 Hypertension

   Diastolic: 80 < 87 < 89 = Prehypertension

These numbers agree fairly with my readings at the gastroenterologist which
were 146/99.  This is evidence the monitor is working properly.  I intend to
present this data to my new doctor on Friday, 2013-02-22.  I expect he will
prescribe blood pressure medication which I will be taking until I croak
someday hopefully many years from now

Apparently a pulse rate anywhere from 60 to 100 is normal.

Julie took the kids to Disney.  Tommy (7) rode on the Yeti ride at Animal
Kingdom.  He overcame his fear, and I complimented him on the phone when he
called.

Worked out with weights.  Making some progress especially in squats and dead
lifts.  When I measured my BP immediately after, the exercise did not seem to
have a significant impact on the readings.

## 2013-02-21

Julie thinks that Aspartame in Diet Pepsi is doing bad things to me.  To rule
out this possibility, I am forgoing diet sodas for the next week, starting
today to see what the effects might be.  I drank a cup of black coffee at work instead.

Today I learned the flamboyant country singer suits with designs a la Rhinstone
Cowboy, back in the 70s are called Nudie Suites after their designer, Nudie
Cohn.

My friend Matt Blaetz's mother, Ruth Blaetz died in Milwaukee at age 67.  She
was stricken with Alzheimer's Disease and was living in an assisted living
facility called Francis House.

## 2013-02-22

I had a physical examination with my new primary care doctor: Michael Burnette,
M.D.  He looked at the blood tests my GI doctor Qazi had ordered.  There were
no abnormalities: liver, thyroid.  He checked my BP twice and got 120/80 each
time, but his nurse got 144/74.  He reviewed my BP records and gave me 14
sample piles of a blood pressure medication called Benicar.  In three weeks I
am going to see him again to assess the effectiveness.  I am hoping to be able
to talk him into a generic medication instead to save money.  The Benicar costs
something like $1.25 per dose.  Wal-Mart sells generic BP meds for $10 for a
90-day supply, or $0.11 per dose. 

The doctor had his nurse do an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check my heart.  To
my dismay, it came back with an "abnormal" result: possible right ventricular
hypertrophy.  He ordered an echocardiogram to rule out this possible heart
problem.  An echocardiogram is supposed to be superior to an EKG for diagnosing
the hypertrophy.

Apparently right ventricular hypertrophy is a heart abnormality where the walls
of the right ventricle are abnormally thick.  It is usually due to long-term
pulmonary (lung) hypertension.  The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs,
and when it is difficult to do that for a long period of time, it thickens.

The good news is that I do not seem to be exhibiting any of the symptoms of
right ventricular hypertrophy: chest pains, shortness of breath, dizziness,
fainting. The doctor thinks that there should not be a problem since I run
regularly without trouble.  My times have not decreased noticeably, although I
did have some trouble completing longer runs of 8 miles or so earlier this
year.  I attributed this to my doing weights (squats) the day before.  It is
conceivable that my heart abnormality made running more difficult, but I'm not
sure it would only show up after so many miles like that.

The bad news is that according to this website http://ecg.utah.edu/lesson/8,
the EKG is correct 90% of the time when right ventricular hypertrophy criteria
are met.

The echocardiogram should cost somewhere around $250 according to http://www.healthcarebluebook.com.

## 2013-02-23

At 9:14 am EST I took my first dose of BP medication.  Immediately before that
My BP measured 135/91.  I measured my BP 3 hours later at 12:15 pm and got an
average of 136/87 after 3 measurements.  Virtually no effect.

I went into the DcR office to work on a project for Derek McPherson: The
Foundry.  I spent the morning reviewing and marking up the drawings.  We are
supposed to issue 50% CDs a week from Monday.

## 2013-02-25

Went to St. Joseph's Hospital on Martin Luther King Jr. Street in Tampa for my
echocardiogram.  The procedure took about 10 minutes.  The radiology technician
could not give me any information.  The data will go to a cardiologist who will
evaluate it.  Then the results will be transcribed and forwarded to my primary
care physician Dr. Burnette.  The tech said it would take 2-3 days' time, which
would be Wednesday or Thursday of this week. 

I am of course nervous about the results.  If I am diagnosed with right
ventricular hypertrophy, I hope it will serve as a lesson to my sons that they
need to take care of their bodies by exercise and regular doctor checkups.


## 2013-02-26

Today I was on a clear liquid diet and started heavy laxatives at noon to clean
out my lower GI tract for my colonoscopy tomorrow.  Here is a brief
play-by-play for the first couple hours:

12:00 took 1st 8 oz miralax
12:00 took 2 dulcolax
12:00 weight 183.8 with shorts and t-shirt
12:15 started 2nd 8 oz miralax
12:16 diarrhea
12:36 it's really working!
1:10 went again
1:18 almost no solids already
1:23 again almost no solids
1:28 wham
1:38 boom
2:11 yucky
2:27 finished last of the miralax

I kind of lost interest in tracking my very frequent bouts after this time.
Suffice it to say it was not an enjoyable process, but I did manage to get
through it with good results.  I was not craving food, surprisingly.  Maybe the
laxatives make the body feel ill and suppress the appetite.  I don't know.  I
was glad to have taken the day off from work; otherwise it would have been
nightmarish. 

## 2013-02-27

Today I had a colonoscopy at Brandon Ambulatory Surgery Center.  I arrived
about 7:45 am as instructed and filled out forms.  I was taken back around 8:30
am and a nurse tried to place an IV in my right hand but failed.  Another nurse
succeeded in my left hand.  I signed some papers and answered some general
questions posed by the nurse.  She had me undress and put on a hospital gown.
I then waited at least a half hour until the anesthesiologist come and spoke to
me.

I informed the anesthesiologist about the possible right ventricular
hypertrophy diagnosis.  He asked me some questions and concluded it was likely
to be a false positive and was not concerned.  He was good about telling me
what to expect from the procedure.

I think it was about 9:15 am when they wheeled me into surgery room 8.  The
anesthesiologist's partner did the actual administering of the drug.  Right as
I started to go under I quipped, "This is what Charlie Sheen feels like all the
time." 

The next thing I knew, I was waking up in the recovery area.  A nurse brought
me a bottle of water which was the first thing I had eaten or drank other than
my blood pressure pill since the day before.  They put me in a wheel chair and
took me out where my wife could join me.  Dr. Qazi (gastroenterologist) then
debriefed me about the colonoscopy.

Dr. Qazi said he found no polyps, that he could rule out colon cancer and that
he took some samples for biopsies to try to ascertain the reason for my
recurring gastric distress.  He said I had some internal hemorrhoids but did
not elaborate.

After the surgery we ate at Steak N Shake which was a blessing.  I slept all
afternoon, woke up around 4 pm and was up until 8:30 pm when I went to bed
again. 

## 2013-02-28

After sleeping all night I slept through my alarm.  I texted my boss Frank and
said I would be in later and slept another hour, arriving at work at 9:00 am.

Tommy exhibited symptoms of pinworms again last night.  This has now been
ongoing for 3 years.  Julie took him to a pediatrician who is asking for stool
samples.

Lo and behold the pediatrician found a mole on the bottom of one of his feet
that concerns her.  She is sending him to a dermatologist.  The concern is
apparently a type of melanoma called "acral lentiginous melanoma" or "plantar
melanoma."  This kind of cancer is rare in Caucasians.  It is what killed the
reggae musician Bob Marley.  Intellectually I know it most likely is a benign
mole, but I am still worried.  It's one thing after another recently: bowels,
blood pressure, heart defect and now this.

I looked at Tommy's mole at lunch.  It is small and has well-defined borders.
It looks exactly like other moles he has on his skin.  I am not very worried,
but I did say to Julie that we should take him to a dermatologist to make sure
it's not that cancer.

TIL there is a type of melanoma (skin cancer) which shows up on the sole of the
foot where there is no sunlight exposure.  Because of its location, it is
particularly dangerous, because it is not often discovered until it has
developed past Stage I.

Julie filled my new BP medicine prescription: Lisinopril 10 mg tablets.  I took
my first one today at 1 pm EST.

There was blood on the tissue when I want #2 tonight around 7:30 pm.  Hopefully
it is nothing serious.  I was kind of constipated, so maybe it's a hemorrhoid.

Started month #3 of my bodybuilding book.  It's bicep intensive.  The kids and
Julie watched Pocahontas while I was out, and I watched the last half hour with
them.

We received the inspection report from an inspector who inspected 819
Walsingham Way on Saturday (3/30).  There are several defects worth noting:

   Roof leak at the chimney.
   
   Rodent droppings and urine in the attic insulation.
   
   Some minor electrical issues.

It appears to me that the contract requires the seller to make repairs up to
1.5% of the price, which would be $2,280.00 in this case.  If the costs exceed
$2,280, we get to pick which ones we want done.

Went to Duke Crystal River to answer questions about the Beck drive installations for Stantec Project No. 198801212.  It's not in my comfort zone what with being mostly a mechanical job.

Worked out at YouFit.  I did my Day #1 routine: chest, back, biceps and triceps.

Tommy and Joey are now taking music lessons.  Tommy is taking drum lessons and Joey piano.


## 2014-08-27

Set up ``journalize.py`` to work on Stantec laptop.

Updated ``.files`` on Stantec laptop.

Got a call from a recruiter, Alyssa Beckler with HCT.  Her phone number is 941-445-4379.  Probably about the same structural position somewhere around Sarasota everyone has been contacting me about.

I moved my office 2 doors down to the west where Josh Bent used to sit, next to Kemba Mays.  This was requested by Stantec to consolidate the power group personnel on second floor and provide space for the transportation group who is moving up from first floor.

Harold Driggers started today as a mechanical designer.  He came from Penn-Pro in Mulberry and was previously with a company that builds reverse osmosis plants on islands and sells the water to the inhabitants.  Stantec spelled his name wrong on his office nametag.

Received laptop battery today.  My old one died.

Mark Noble treated everyone to lunch at the Bunker.  I had the Washington Turkey sandwich which was pretty good as always.

Tommy and Joey had their first Fall Baseball practices.  Julie and I worked our concession shift from 8:00 am to 11:45 am.  I ran the grill and Julie worked the window.

## 2014-09-07

Went to YouFit to work out and pulled a muscle in my lower back at the 4th repetition of the 4th set of squats.  I was squatting 145 lbs.  The pain was immediate.  I went home and iced my back and tried to keep from putting stress on it.

Our AC quit working, so Julie called a repair man.  It was Sunday.  The repair man kindly pointed out it was a safety switch which detects when the drain line is clogged.  We tried several things to unclog the drain line, including sucking on its discharge end with a shop vac and pouring drain cleaner down it, but it has been no use.  The AC is working, but only because the safety switch is currently defeated by removing it from its socket.

Julie took Tommy and Joey to the bowling alley.  Tommy went to a birthday party, and Julie took Joey and his friend Gabe to bowl as a special treat since Tommy attended two birthday parties this weekend.

My back was sore when I went to bed, and it was hard to sleep.

## 2014-09-08

My back was very sore and stiff when I got up, so much so that I found it hard to walk.  A hot shower helped, and I spent some 15 minutes stretching it thoroughly.  I also took two extra strength Tylenol.

I didn't know if I could do it, but I went to Duke's Hines plant anyway and was able to function all day.  It was mostly walking and sitting with a little bending over and kneeling to get through some tight spaces.  By the time my back muscles were warmed up I was doing pretty well.

Received a phone call from Steve Ericson (sp?) with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).  His number is 850-528-5404.  He said I will be contacted next week by Mark Beynon, the local inspector for my area.  Mark's number is 850-528-5391.

## 2014-09-09

My back was again stiff and sore.  If yesterday was a 10, today was probably an 8.  It loosened up after a hot shower a little, but not as well as it did yesterday.  There were certainly fewer instances of gasping pain today, but it was stiff and sore all day.  I took one Ibuprofen this morning which did not seem to work as well as the Tylenol yesterday.


## 2014-09-10

If Monday was a 10, I would say today in the morning my back was about a 6, but by the time I got to work it was an 8.  It might be because I am not as physically active today being in the office and not in the field.  I took 1 Advil before I left home.

My weight was 162.4 this morning.  My goal is to get to 160 and then keep it between 160 and 165 by watching my caloric intake.

Bruce Ward is in town to meet with some clients and his employees.

Joey had baseball practice last night, and Julie said he did well catching grounders and even caught a couple fly balls.  He showed improvement since the spring.  I stayed home with Tommy, fed him and read him a story before bed.  Tommy has practice on Thursday.

The weather is cooler today than it has been for the past month.  It's only going to get up to 92 deg F whereas it has been hovering in the 96-99 range for a while.

## 2014-09-15

It's been 8 days since I hurt my back, and I think I am not at a 1 relative to the first day after the injury being a 10.  It's not a zero, but it's nearly a zero.  I am planning to do a light workout on Thursday for the first time since I hurt myself.
